# This script translates problems from the OpenAI HumanEval dataset into bash.
#
# Installed version is:
# GNU bash, version 5.1.16(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
#
# Bash is not a general-purpose programming language, and has its own quirks to work around.
# In particular, the main datatype is string. While Bash has arrays and associative arrays,
# the convention is to use strings with spaces and/or newlines as separators.
#
# This makes the translation tricky, as we can't pass strings around and concatenate them.
# If we have a list, we need to know if its elements are lists or base values, since
# that determines the list encoding. Therefore, we defer translation and pass Python
# values around. Only deep_equality() and gen_call() need to return strings, so
# they call py_to_bash() to perform the translation.
#
# Known limitations:
#   1. List elements containing whitespace are not supported
#   2. More than two layers of nesting is not supported
#   3. Nested dictionaries are not supported
#
# 2 and 3 do not occur in the dataset, but 1 does.
# The translator tries to check for these cases and terminates if they are encountered.

# Translation of Python values into Bash strings is deferred until this point.
# Non-list values have already been translated to Bash syntax.
# There are three cases:
#   1.  Empty list: this is translated to an empty string.
#   2a. List of dictionaries: not supported
#   2b. Nested list with more than two layers of nesting: not supported
#   2c. Nested list: the inner lists are recursively translated (which results in
#       a quoted, space-separated string), unquoted, and then joined with newlines.
#   2d. List: the elements are recursively translated (which results in quoted strings),
#       unquoted, and then joined with spaces.
#   3a. Nested dictionary: not supported
#   3b. Dictionary: the dictionary is translated to CSV format, in key,value order.
