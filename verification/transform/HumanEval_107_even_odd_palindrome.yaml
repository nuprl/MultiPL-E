prompt: "from typing import Tuple\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n: int) -> Tuple[int,\
  \ int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the\
  \ number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1,\
  \ n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n    >>> even_odd_palindrome(3)\n    (1, 2)\n\
  \        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even,\
  \ and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n    >>> even_odd_palindrome(12)\n\
  \    (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\
  \ 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n \
  \       1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and\
