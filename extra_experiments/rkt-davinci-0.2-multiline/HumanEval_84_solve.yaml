    I have tried to solve this problem but I am not getting the correct output.\n\

    \n\nA:\n\nYou're on the right track, but you're not quite there yet.\nThe problem\
    \ with your approach is that you're not summing the digits of the binary number,\
    \ you're just counting them.\nFor example, if you try to solve the problem for\
    \ the number <code>150</code>, you're converting it to binary, which gives you\
    \ <code>10010110</code>, and then you're counting the digits, which gives you\
    \ <code>8</code>.\nBut the correct answer is <code>6</code>, because the sum of\
    \ the digits in binary is <code>1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0</code>.\nThe solution\
    \ is to convert the number to binary, and then sum the digits.\n", "  (define\
