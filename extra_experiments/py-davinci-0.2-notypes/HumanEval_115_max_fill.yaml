prompt: "def max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular\
  \ grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,\n    and each 1 in a row represents\
  \ a single unit of water.\n    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be\
  \ used to extract water from it, \n    and all buckets have the same capacity.\n\
  \    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.\n    Output the number\
  \ of times you need to lower the buckets.\n\n    Example 1:\n    >>> max_fill([[0,\
  \ 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 1)\n    6\n\n    Example 2:\n    >>> max_fill([[0,\
  \ 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]], 2)\n    5\n    \n    Example\
  \ 3:\n    >>> max_fill([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], 5)\n    0\n\n    Constraints:\n \
