    \ do the first way I described in my question.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I explained\
    \ it already. `+` is simply not defined for `factors`. To be honest, I don't understand\
    \ why you even want to do that at all - it's much less efficient to convert to\
    \ numeric only to convert it back again.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: You can't use `+`\
    \ to add factors. Factors are not numeric as such and so can't be added or subtracted\
    \ at all. You can add factors to numeric vectors, but not the other way around.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Thanks for your explanation. I'm new here and I find it very\
    \ hard to accept the answer and you guys are really helpful. I'll go through some\
    \ more tutorials to see what I can do. Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: No\
    \ worries. Just remember to accept the answer that best answers your question\
    \ (if any). You can always upvote multiple answers if you have enough reputation\
    \ to do so.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nIn R you can add two factors by converting them\
    \ to numeric values first and then adding them. However, the results are not the\
    \ same as the sum of the levels.\n<code>\n> as.numeric(factor(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"\
    c\"))) + as.numeric(factor(c(\"b\",\"a\",\"c\")))\n[1] 2 0 4\n</code>\nOne way\
    \ to get what you want is to convert the factors to characters and then to numerics:\n\
    <code>\n> factor(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")) + as.numeric(factor(c(\"b\",\"a\",\"c\"\
    )))\n[1] 2 1 4\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=4 tags=r,factors,sum,numeric |>\n<| c |>\n\
    And another way is to use `as.numeric(as.character(...))` instead of `as.numeric(...)`\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThis works, assuming your numeric variable is called num:\n\
    <code>\nfactor(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")) + factor(c(\"b\",\"a\",\"c\"))\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a tags=r,factors,sum,numeric dscore=4 |>\n<| c |>\nThis was my first thought\
    \ too, but `as.numeric(factor(c(\"a\",\"b", "\n\treturn(x + y)\n}\n", "\n  x +\
    \ y\n}\n</cell>\n<code language=r-spark21>", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nNow we can\
    \ test it out with some examples.\n<code>\n> add(1, 2)\n[1] 3\n> add(2, 3)\n[1]\
    \ 5\n> add(5, 7)\n[1] 12\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| a |>\nIn R, you could do this\
    \ by defining a function that will return the sum of the 2 numbers and use it\
    \ as the second parameter to Reduce\n<code>\n> Reduce(`+`, c(1,2), init=0) \n\
    [1] 3\n> Reduce(`+`, c(1,3), init=0) \n[1] 5\n> Reduce(`+`, c(5,7), init=0) \n\
    [1] 12\n</code>\nFor an arbitrary number of parameters to add or subtract, simply\
    \ call Reduce with the appropriate number of arguments per call\n<|/ a tags=r,function\
    \ dscore=4 |>\n<| a dscore=3 |>\nYou could define your function in the following\
    \ way:\n<code>\nadd <- function(a, b) {\n   a + b\n}\n</code>\nOr, if you are\
    \ using RStudio:\n<code>\nadd <- function(...) {\n   sum(...)\n}\n</code>\nIf\
    \ you want this as a function of some input variables, you can then call it as\
    \ follows:\n<code>\n> add(3,5)\n[1] 8\n> add(1,2,3)\n[1] 5\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=r,function\
    \ |>\n<| a tags=r,function dscore=3 |>\nYou can add them as a list:\n<code>\n\

    }\n", "\n  # Make sure x and y are numbers\n  if (is.numeric(x) && is.numeric(y))\
    \ {\n    # Return x + y\n    return(x + y)\n  } else {\n    # Return error message\n\
    \    return(\"Please use numeric values\")\n  }\n}\n", "\n\treturn(x + y)\n}\n",
  "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=python,r dscore=5 |>\n<| c |>\nI agree, this\

    \ is also a pretty good IDE.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for answering.  I guess\
    \ I'm just surprised that R doesn't have this.  I suppose it is more a feature\
    \ of R than a feature.  I just think that it's strange that R doesn't have a similar\
    \ syntax to Python or Ruby.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI guess the problem with the question\
    \ is this one: why python has an operator for \"add two numbers\" but not for\
    \ \"add two objects\"?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, well I don't have any specific answer\
    \ but I think it is because of the fact that python is dynamically typed while\
    \ R is statically typed. Also R has dynamic scoping where as Python has lexical\
    \ scoping which means you do not need to declare variables in a function to use\
    \ them outside the function. Thus functional programming in R is also a little\
    \ more similar to functional programming in python (even though you can achieve\
    \ similar results with both)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nOne alternative to R is SLIME\n\

    \ R and Python.  Great work guys!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python,r |>\nYou can use\

    <|/ c |>", "\n  return(x + y)\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=3 |>\n<| a |>\nMy solution\
    \ for adding, subtracting and multiplying. This approach is based on functional\
    \ programming. \n<code>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n    # Check that x and y are integers\n\
    \    stopifnot(is.integer(x), is.integer(y))\n    # Check that both numbers are\
    \ positive\n    stopifnot(x >= 0, y >= 0)\n    # Return x+y\n    return(x+y)\n\
    }\n", "\n    x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nThe syntax for declaring functions\
    \ is very similar to mathematical functions - the function name is surrounded\
    \ by parentheses, followed by the parameters in the following list. Those parameters\
    \ are usually numeric, but they can contain other data types. The body of the\
    \ function can be empty, as in this example. For more information about functions,\
    \ see the R Language Manual. Here's the entire function definition for add:\n\
    <code>", "\n  if (x == 0 || y == 0) stop(\"At least one argument is zero\")\n\
    \  return(x+y)\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nThe output shows that the function\
    \ has changed the values of x and y. So why did it change it?\nThis is because\
    \ R passes by value. So when you passed x <- 2, you passed the value 2 and not\
    \ a reference to a variable that holds 2. So when you pass x, that does not change\
    \ the original value.\nIf you wanted to change the original values so you can\
    \ use the same values later in your code, you could use an environment:\n<code>",
  "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  return(x + y)\n}\n</cell>\n<cell>", "\n\
    \    return(x+y)\n}\n", "\n    x + y\n}\n", "\n    x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n",

    \ the add function by checking the results.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "\n  x + y\n\

    \ && is.numeric(y)) {\n    result <- x + as.numeric(y)\n  } else if (is.atomic(x)\
    \ && is.atomic(y)) {\n    result <- x + y\n  } else {\n    result <- NA\n  }\n\
    \  return(result)\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  # Return the sum of x and y\n\
    \  return(x + y)\n}\n", "\n\tx + y\n}", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nAs you see, there\
    \ is only one place where we can change this function:\n<code>", "\n  return(x\
    \ + y)\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n    x +\

    \ y) {\n  return(x + y)\n}\n</code>\nThis example demonstrates the use of local\
    \ variables and how their value persists between function calls. Let's walk through\
    \ some steps:\n<code>", "\n    # Define a variable named z to be equal to x +\
    \ y\n    z <- x + y\n\n    # Print out z\n    print(z)\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n",
  "\n  if (x < y) { \n    x + y\n  } else if (x > y) {\n    x - y\n  } else {\n  \

    Yes, it is definitely correct. But I would like to see how it's done with R.\n\

    newvector <- myvector + 1\n</code>\nTo remove an element from a vector:\n<code>\n\
    myvector = c(1:10)\nnewvector <- myvector[-3]\n</code>\nTo concatenate two vectors:\n\
    <code>\nmyvector = c(1:10)\nmyvector2 = c(11:20)\nmyvector <- c(myvector, myvector2)\n\
    </code>\nTo remove a range of elements from a vector:\n<code>\nmyvector = c(1:10)\n\

    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=3 tags=r,vector,add |>\n<| c |>\nJust to clarify: adding\
    \ one to a vector works the same as a string. E.g., `c(1:10)+1` will return the\
    \ vector `c(1:11)`. To add a number to a vector, you must explicitly tell R that\
    \ you're adding (as in `c(1:10)+1`, not `1+c(1:10)`).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nTo clarify\
    \ further, `c(1:10)` evaluates to `c(1:10)`, and `c(1:10)+1` evaluates to `c(1:11).`\n\
    <|/ c |>", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nNote that I removed the return statement from\
    \ the function definition. R doesn't need to know the return value of a function\
    \ when it is used as an expression by another function, as is the case with add().\
    \ The return statement is what tells R to return the value computed by add(),\
    \ not the value returned by add(). For example, if we were to run add(1, 2), the\
    \ function would need to return 3 before it could return a value of 2 to the calling\
    \ function like 2 + 3, but R would return 3 to us. This is called lazy evaluation.\
    \ \nWe could have used the return statement to return the result of the add()\
    \ function and R would have returned 3 to us:\n<code>\n> add(2, 3)\n[1] 3\n</code>\n\
    But it would be better to just return the value of add():\n<code>\n> 2 + 3\n[1]\
    \ 5\n</code>\nWhen you run a function in R, R will look for a variable with the\
    \ same name as the function. The variables are created when you define the function.\
    \ For example, when we run the first line of the function definition above, R's\
    \ environment will look like this:\n<code>\n> environment(add)\n<environment:\
    \ R_GlobalEnv>\n</code>\nThe variable named add is now created. When we run the\
    \ second line of the function definition above, R's environment will look like\
    \ this:\n<code>\n<environment: 0x000002b152b25d00>\n</code>\nThis time, add is\
    \ a variable in the environment 0x000002b152b25d00. When we run the third line\
    \ of the function definition above, R's environment will look like this:\n<code>\n\
    <environment: 0x000002b152b25d00>\n</code>\nAnd so on and so forth. The variable\
    \ named add now exists in the environment. \nThe environment can be accessed using\
    \ the get function:\n<code>\n> get(add)\nfunction (x, y = NULL) \n{\n  x + y\n\
    }\n</code>\nThe get function returns the contents of the environment as a variable.\
    \ \n<code>\n> add(2, 3)\n[1] 5\n</code>\nWe can also use get to get a variable\
    \ from a different environment:\n<code>\n> e <- new.env()\n> e$add <- function\
    \ (x, y = NULL) \n+   {\n+     x + y\n+   }\n> e$add(1, 2) # add is defined in\
    \ the global environment\n[1] 3\n> e$add(3, 4)\n[1] 5\n</code>\nNow that we know\
    \ the basic syntax for defining functions, we can move on to the syntax for passing\
    \ arguments to functions. A function is just a set of instructions that R executes\
    \ every time you run a command. In the same way that R knows what to do and how\
    \ to do it when you run a statement, R knows what to do and how to do it when\
    \ you run ", "\n  x + y\n}\n</cell>\n<text>\nLet's now define another function\
    \ which adds the product of two numbers:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "\n    # add x\
    \ to y\n    # return a + b\n    stopifnot(length(x) == length(y))\n    stopifnot(length(x)\
    \ > 0)\n    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n    stopifnot(is.numeric(y))\n    return(x\
    \ + y)\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=r |>\n<| c |>\nThis is great!\

    \ a subroutine) is a block of code which you can execute. You can define it in\
    \ a script, or in a text file (.txt) which you read into R; you can define it\
    \ in a R script (.R) or in a text file (.txt) which you read into Python; and\
    \ you can define it in a text file (.txt) which you read into SAS, R, C, C++,\
    \ or any other programming language.\nYou might wonder why we do not define the\
    \ function add inside an R script? The reason is that the function add() is not\
    \ a variable in the current R session. It is a function defined in an external\
    \ file. What happens if I run R without loading this file? I will refer to that\
    \ file as test.R later. Let's assume that this file is empty, except for the function\
    \ definition, as follows:\n<code>", "\n  return(x+y)\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n",
  "\n\tz <- x + y\n\tz\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  return(x+y);\n};\n</code>\nThen\
    \ we use the function in our R code.\n<code>", "\n  return(x+y)\n}\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a dscore=4 tags=function,r,function |>\n<| c |>\nIt's also possible to define\

    \ |>\nFunctions defined in R can be defined either using \"return\" function or\
    \ using the \"<<-\" operator. \n\"return\" function\nA \"return\" function returns\
    \ a value, that is returned as the result of the function.\n<code>\nmyFunction\
    \ <- function(x) {\n    return(x + 1)\n}\nmyFunction(10)\n</code>\nUsing \"return\"\
    \ function\nWe can also use the following syntax to define a function that returns\
    \ the result of adding an argument to 1:\n<code>\nmyFunction <- function(x) {\n\
    \    x + 1\n}\nmyFunction(10)\n</code>\n\"<<-\" operator\nUsing \"<<-\" operator,\
    \ we can do the following:\n<code>\nmyFunction <- function(x) {\n    x <<- x +\
    \ 1\n}\nmyFunction(10)\n</code>\nBoth are equivalent and both return the result\
    \ of the function as return value of myFunction\n<|/ a dscore=3 |>\n<| a |>\n\
    When you define a function without using the return function, R will just return\
    \ the last expression in the function. This behavior can be modified by using\
    \ the return function or by using the <<- operator. Below is an example of the\
    \ return function:\n<code>\nmyFunc <- function(x) {\n  x + 1\n}\n\nmyFunc(10)\
    \ # returns 11\n\nmyFunc2 <- function(x) {\n  return(x+1)\n}\n\nmyFunc2(10) #\

    \ an example. \n<code>\nmyFunction <- function(x) {\n    x <<- x + 1\n}\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a |>\n<| a tags=function,r,function |>\nThe return function is used to return\
    \ the result of the function while in the <<- operator is used to assign values\

    Cannot add numbers with NA\")\n  }\n  z\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nIf you\
    \ wanted to add two numbers that you could read from a file, it might look like\
    \ this:\n<code>", "\n    x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}", "\n    # Convert both arguments\
    \ to a numeric vector\n    x <- as.numeric(x)\n    y <- as.numeric(y)\n\n    #\
    \ Add them up\n    x + y\n}\n</code>\nNote that your function add() is not vectorized.\
    \ When you call it with a vector, your function returns a vector (that is the\
    \ addition of the whole vector). The solution here is to change the function to\
    \ be vectorized, which means you need to provide it a vector, and it will return\
    \ the same vector but with the addition of the vector's values. For example:\n\
    <code>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n    x + y\n}\n", "\n  return(x + y)\n}\n</code>\n\
    The second is the base R function sum.\n<code>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  if (is.numeric(x))\
    \ x + y\n  else if (is.numeric(y)) x + y\n  else x + y\n}\n</code>\nNow we can\
    \ test the results of our functions by applying the functions to the numbers they\

    \ given as arguments and then use Reduce (which applies a function to each pair\
    \ of adjacent elements of a list) to add the vectors (i.e., recursively). Thus,\
    \ we would have :\n<code>\nadd <- function(...) {\n  Reduce(`+`, list(...))\n\

    \ element of the vector to the result of the add call. If we pass two vectors\
    \ as arguments, the Reduce call will add the second element of the first vector\
    \ to the result of the add call of the first argument, etc. The ... is needed\
    \ to make sure that we get the correct number of arguments in the function.\n\
    Then, if we want to add two vectors x and y where y is unknown, we just need to\

    \ |>\nFrom the R Language Definition (Section 2.3):\n\nThe <- assignment operator\
    \ (sometimes called \u201C<- assignment operator\u201D)\n  is syntactic sugar\
    \ for <-. The form <- assignment operator is provided\n  to simplify the syntax\
    \ for assignment of new variables into a calling\n  environment. This convenience\
    \ is particularly useful for programming\n  languages that support operator overloading\
    \ (Hadley Wickham has called\n  them \"compound assignment\" operators). For example,\
    \ when one assigns\n  the value 3 to a variable x, a variable x is created in\
    \ the local\n  environment, with the corresponding value 3.\n\n<code>\n> x <-\
    \ c(3, 5)\n> x\n[1] 3 5\n> x<-5\n> x\n[1] 5\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=5 |>\n<| c\

    For a more generalized solution, consider this R package: https://cran.r-project.org/package=Ops\n\
    It allows for customization of most operators (including assignment, etc).\n<code>",

    \ a data.table solution that should be pretty efficient, and also gives a more\
    \ complete answer (as you mentioned in the comments):\n<code>\nlibrary(data.table)\n\
    dt <- data.table(x = 1:100, y = 1:100)\ndt[, .(\n    sum = x + y\n), by = .(\n\
    \    x = seq(1, 100, by = 1)\n)]\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| a tags=r |>\nHere is a\

    \nmyFun2 <- function(x){\n  lapply(x, myFun)\n}\n\nmyFun2 <- Vectorize(myFun2)\n\
    </code>\nThis solution works because it applies the function elementwise to all\
    \ the elements in x.\n<code>\n> x <- c(1,2,3)\n> myFun2(x)\n[[1]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[2]]\n\

    \ approach with Map and Reduce -\n<code>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  return(x+y)\n\
    }\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nWhat I did was I rewrote my code so that I added\
    \ the function to the namespace and added the argument names. I added the return\
    \ type to the function as well as the actual return value. Because the function\
    \ I created add() does not have an explicit return type or explicit return value\
    \ I added the code to the namespace so that it would be accessible to other functions.\n\
    To use it, I simply called the function add with two numeric arguments. When you\
    \ call the function add with the line add(2, 3) it will return 5 to the console\
    \ because I rewrote the function to add the two numbers x and y together and return\
    \ the value.\nTo make these two things happen, you have to define the function\
    \ and add it to the namespace within the main R script you are working in.\n<|/\

    \ itself :\n<code>\nfunction (x, y = 1) \nx + y\n<bytecode: 0x55b443e5cb00>\n\
    <environment: namespace:base>\n</code>\nSo you can use it like\n<code>\nmyAdd(5,\

    <| c |>\nHappy to help. Happy coding!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=r |>\nThere are two\
    \ things you need to do:\n\nAssign the return value to a new variable (using <-)\
    \ \nReturn the value from the function (using return)\n\nLike so:\n<code>\nadd\
    \ <- function(x, y) {\n    x + y\n}\n\nadd(2, 3)\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=3 |>\n\
    <| a dscore=3 tags=r |>\nWhen you do add <- function(x, y) ..., you're assigning\
    \ the function object to add. Thus you can then use add with two arguments: add(2,\
    \ 3).\nWhen you do x + y, you're actually evaluating x + y, which returns the\
    \ result of that addition. Since you're not assigning or returning the result\
    \ of the addition, you would need to use return(x + y) to return the result of\
    \ that addition.\n<|/ a |>\n<| a dscore=2 tags=r |>\nIt seems like you are having\
    \ trouble understanding how R works internally, so I'll try to provide a bit of\
    \ a deeper explanation.\nIn R, you don't define functions with the function keyword,\
    \ rather you use the function keyword. Your function should look like:\n<code>\n\
    myFunction <- function(x,y){\n    return(x+y)\n}\n</code>\nWhat is this doing?\n\
    The function keyword simply creates a new type of object called a function. It\
    \ looks like a variable assignment but the value doesn't change, so it just creates\
    \ a new object. What it does is, when you run it, it passes two arguments to the\
    \ function. So:\n<code>\nmyFunction(x,y)\n</code>\nis actually calling the function\
    \ with the values x and y, just like you were typing in the function. \nThe function\
    \ object itself is also an object, as can be seen by running \n<code>\nmyFunction\n\
    </code>\nTo assign a value to it, you use the <- assignment:\n<code>\nmyFunction\
    \ <- function(x,y){\n    return(x+y)\n}\n</code>\nNow that you have your function\
    \ object assigned to a variable, you can call it in two ways:\n1- By itself\n\
    <code>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n   x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n\nprint(add(2, 3))\n\
    print(add(5, 7))\n</cell>\n<cell>", "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=r,tidyverse\
    \ |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=r,tidyverse |>\nOne possibility is to define your function\
    \ first, and then use mapply with the function as the second parameter. Here's\
    \ a working example where I define a function to calculate the sum, then use mapply\
    \ to apply it to multiple vectors of length 2:\n<code>", "\n  # Return the sum\
    \ of the two numbers\n  return(x + y)\n}\n", "\n\treturn(x+y)\n}\n", "\n  x +\
    \ y\n}\n</cell>\n<text>\nThe functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide all\
    \ take in two arguments, the values you want to add/subtract/multiply/divide them,\
    \ and return the result.  If you wanted to add and multiply together, you'd run\
    \ these two commands:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nadd(2, 3)\nmultiply(3, 5)\n</cell>\n\
    <text>\nWhen you have a large number of numbers to add/multiply, or when you have\
    \ a lot of data, you can use a for loop to avoid having to type out all the numbers.\
    \  Instead of typing out numbers in sequence, you can put them in a vector (a\
    \ sequence of numbers) and then use that vector to do the calculation.  Let's\
    \ try this out.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  return(x + y);\n\
    }\n</cell>\n<cell>", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n    return(x+y)\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=r\
    \ |>\n<| a dscore=2 |>\nYou can use functions from the R package psych. The function\
    \ decompose.lm() function returns coefficients and intercept for a linear model:\n\
    <code>\nlibrary(psych)\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n",
  "\n  if (x < y) {\n    stop(paste0('Error: x', x, ' < ', y))\n  }\n  x + y\n}\n\
    </cell>\n<cell>", "\n  x + y\n}", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\nadd <- function(x,\
    \ y) {\n  x + y\n}", "\n  result <- x + y;\n  return(result)\n}\n</code>\nThen\
    \ you can just call the function and store the result in a new variable.\n<code>",
  "\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nSo add is a function which takes two arguments, x and y,\
    \ and adds them together and returns x + y.\nNext, we define a function add2 which\
    \ is like the add function except it adds two numbers together and returns a result\
    \ (that is a number). We do this by defining another function add2.\n<code>\n\
    add2 <- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nNow we define a second function\
    \ add3 which is like add2 except that it returns a string. We do this by defining\
    \ another function add3.\n<code>\nadd3 <- function(x, y) {\n  \"Add these numbers\
    \ together\"\n}\n</code>\nNow we can add those functions together with do.call.\
    \ do.call takes a function and a list of arguments and executes that function\
    \ with the arguments in that list. The first function we defined was called add\
    \ and the second function we defined was called add2 and those arguments we gave\
    \ to do.call are x and y. The first function we defined was called add and the\
    \ second function we defined was called add2 and the arguments of those functions\
    \ were x and y. All three functions are defined, so we can add them together with\
    \ do.call.\n<code>", "\n  x + y;\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n\tx + y\n}", "\n\
    \  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}\n", "\n  x + y\n}", "\n  print(paste(\"Adding \"\
    , x, y))\n  x + y\n}\n</code>\nThen you can call add from within a function like\
    \ this:\n<code>\nadd_num <- function(x) {\n  print(paste(\"Adding a number \"\
    , x))\n  add(x, 3)\n}\n</code>\nThen you call the function add_num like this:\n\
    <code>\nadd_num(2)\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks! The answer from\
