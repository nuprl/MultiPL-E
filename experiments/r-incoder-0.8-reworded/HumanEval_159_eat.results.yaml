    The total number of carrots eaten by the rabbit.\nThe number of carrots remaining.\n\
    \nThe first can be done using base R's sum and subtraction.\n<code>\neaten <-\
    \ function(n, r) {\n  sum(n - r)\n}\n</code>\nThe second can be done using base\
    \ R's diff function.\n<code>\nremaining_carrots <- function(n, r) {\n  diff(c(n,\
    \ r))\n}\n</code>\nThe first function requires the parameters to be passed in\
    \ as numbers, as is the case with all the other solutions posted so far. The second\
    \ function requires the parameters to be passed in as integers.\n<|/ a dscore=0\
    \ tags=function,r |>\n<| a tags=function,r dscore=0 |>\nAnother option is to define\
    \ a function where you need to pass the number of carrots and the number of carrots\
    \ remaining from your rabbit before eating. Once you do that then you just need\
    \ to call the function like you normally would.\n<code>\neatRabbit <- function(carrots,\
    \ carrots_remaining){\n  # your code to eat rabbits\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<|\
    \ a |>\nHere's another possible approach, similar to Sabuj's approach, but using\
    \ R's built-in diff function.  \n<code>\neatRabbit <- function(carrots, carrots_remaining)\
    \ {\n    carrots <- c(0,carrots,0)\n    carrots_remaining <- c(0,carrots_remaining,0)\n\
    \    n <- carrots[-length(carrots)]\n    r <- carrots_remaining[-length(carrots_remaining)]\n\
    \    carrots_remaining <- carrots_remaining - n\n    if (r == 0) return(carrots)\n\
    \    carrots <- carrots + diff(c(0,r,0))\n    return(carrots)\n}\n</code>\nExample\
    \ usage:\n<code>\neatRabbit(\ntest_humaneval <- function() {\ncandidate <- eat\n\

    <text>\nGreat Job!\nThat is all for this course. Next up: Dungeons and Dragons.\
    \ It's time for you to make your first Dungeons and Dragons game.\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <text>\nDungeons and Dragons: Part 1\nThe D&D games are a great way to become\
    \ comfortable with R, and it's the first of several D&D games to come to mind.\n\
    \nThe game you're playing is a dungeon crawler. Where a player controls the player\
    \ that needs to crawl some areas to collect items from your dungeon. The player\
    \ has two options to choose from, and you've been given several rooms to traverse\
    \ through to get to the dungeon.\n\nThe Dungeon Crawler Game Rules\nThe rules\
    \ of the game are as follows:\n\nThe dungeon crawler is located on the left side\
    \ of a 15 square grid.\nThe player can move in four directions (N, S, E, W); these\
    \ directions are in clockwise order, i.e. N, S, E, W are the same as E, S, W,\
    \ N.\nA monster can move in four directions, again, in clockwise order, i.e. N,\
    \ S, E, W are the same as E, S, W, N.\nAn item appears in a random room.\nThe\
    \ player can choose up to three monsters to kill off the monsters before they\
    \ can move on to the next room; after they move on to the next room, they cannot\
    \ move again.\nAfter the player has traversed through all rooms and kills all\
    \ monsters, they can move back to the start room.\nIf the player moves off a room,\
    \ they lose.\nThe game ends when no more monsters are left.\nAt each room, there\
    \ are some monsters that need to collect a number of items to complete the dungeon.\n\
    A dungeon crawler always starts at the start room.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nThe Crawler\
    \ Function\nSo the crawler's move is a simple function that tells you where to\

    \ arguments: a vector of car prices that represent a car's sales in dollars,\n\
    a vector of car sales numbers that represent the number of carrots eaten during\
    \ the week, and\na vector of car sales numbers that represent the number of carrots\
    \ left in the car stock.\nThe function should return a vector representing the\
    \ car hunger percentage of the week.\nThe function should return NAs when all\
    \ of the carrots are eaten. \nYour function should return 0 when all of the carrots\
    \ are eaten. \nExamples:\n>>> hunger (c(1, 3, 4, 5), c(5, 3, 8, 2), c(5, 7, 10,\
    \ 9))\nc(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1)\n>>> hunger (c(1, 3, 4, 5), c(5, 3, 8, 2), c(5, 7,\

    \ Please read the info about [how to ask a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)\
    \ and how to give a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269).\
    \ This will make it much easier for others to help you.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI've\
    \ edited the question. Hope you can help me. Thanks a lot.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0\
    \ |>\nYour question is not very clear. As I see it, you only need to use your\
    \ defined function eat to count the number of carrots left. I think a simple solution\
    \ would be to define eat as:\n<code>\neat <- function(number, need, remaining)\
    \ {\n  \n  if (number > need) {\n    \n    remaining\n    \n  } else {\n    \n\
    \    need <- number - 1\n    \n    remaining <- need + number - need\n    \n \
    \ }\n  \n}\n\n</code>\nAnd then use it to count the number of carrots left:\n\
    <code>\ncarrots <- c(5, 6, 10)\n\nprint(eat(carrots, 6, 10)) # 7\n\nprint(eat(carrots,\
    \ 9, 10)) # 4\n\nprint(eat(carrots, 10, 10)) # 3\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=r |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nSorry, it's my fault. I edited the question a little. I also need to know\
    \ how many carrots I have eaten.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay, so how do you define\
    \ `eat(5, 6, 10)` then? I mean how do you know that there are 5 carrots left after\
    \ that call? I don't see that anywhere in your code.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYour\
    \ edit makes things even more confusing. Can you please clarify how you came to\
    \ that conclusion?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited the question a little. Thanks\
    \ again.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nHere's a solution that only uses the eat function\
    \ to do the calculations.\n<code>\neat <- function(number, need, remaining) {\n\

    \ Problem\nYour goal for this problem is to write an R function that computes\
    \ the average of a vector.  \nYou will be given 2 vectors:\n\na numeric vector,\
    \ call it x of numeric values.\na numeric vector, call it y of numeric values\n\
    \nThe function should return:\n\nthe average of x and y\n\nYou should only use\
    \ basic R, and your function should NOT have any loops or if statements.\nYou\
    \ can use any R functions (i.e., no lapply, apply, etc.) in your function.  The\
    \ function should return the mean of the vector x divided by the mean of the vector\
    \ y.\n\nExample:\ntest_humaneval <- function() {\ncandidate <- eat\n    if(!identical(candidate(5,\

    \ question:\nIf the carrots that you have eaten is less than the number of carrots\
    \ that you need to eat, you should reduce the number of carrots that you need\
    \ to eat. \nYou need to help your smart dog decide the number of carrots to eat,\
    \ so that he can efficiently eat as much as possible.\n\nExample:\n>>> eat(2,\

    \ 3\nFor this coding exercise, we have provided you with a function\nthat computes\
    \ how many seconds have elapsed since midnight.\n\nThe time at which the function\
    \ should stop will be midnight on the second Sunday of January 2010.\n\nFor example:\n\
    \nMidnight:  January 21, 2010 12:00:00 AM\nStop:     January 22, 2010 12:00:00\
    \ AM\n\nThe difference between those dates is 1 day.\n\nHint 1:  We will use the\
    \ difftime function from base R to compute the difference between two dates in\
    \ days.  Please read the documentation of this function by typing help(difftime)\
    \ into the console.\n\nHint 2:  We will use ifelse to determine which day of the\
    \ month the first date is in, then use a simple subtraction to compute the time\
    \ elapsed since midnight.\n\nHint 3:  Use the ISOdate function from lubridate\
    \ (from the tidyverse package) to get the proper date formatter.\n\n\n</text>\n\

    \ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nHi, your solutions work perfectly for the example, but\
    \ if you change the ```need``` to ```need = c(1,3,4)``` and ```number = c(4,3,7)```\
    \ then this solution will not work. Thus if you think about it for a while, I\
    \ believe there should be a condition checking if ```remaining >= 0``` or something\
    \ like that because ```need = c(1,3,4)``` does not satisfy the ```need <= remaining```\
    \ condition because ```remaining = 2```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see what you mean.\
    \ I was thinking about this when I wrote my answer, but did not have time to refactor\
    \ it. Thanks for pointing that out! Edited my answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=r |>\n\
    Here is a base R solution:\n<code>\neat <- function(number, need, remaining) {\n\

    \ when I try to pass them an argument that is very large (like N > 100), it gives\

    \ the problem of recycling nimballs in your nimball shelf. Here's how it works:\n\
    \nThe nimball shelf consists of nimballs and some empty spaces.\nThere are nimballs\
    \ that can be eaten without losing any nimballs\nThere are nimballs in stock\n\

    \n    You have N carrots, need to eat X number of them before Robin is hungry.\n\
    \    But there are some problems:\n    1) Not all carrots are eaten before. There\
    \ are some remaining carrots left.\n    2) Not all carrots are eaten before. There\
    \ are some remaining carrots left.\n    3) Not all carrots are eaten before. There\
    \ are some remaining carrots left.\n    4) Not all carrots are eaten before. There\
    \ are some remaining carrots left.\n    You need to find out the number of eaten\
    \ carrots and the number of carrots left after your meals so Robin will be hungry.\

    \ |>\nThis is a problem that is a mathematical one. \nLet's define this as eating\
    \ (need) carrots out of (number). That means that you have to have enough carrots\
    \ to eat. If that number < need, the eating is done with carrots. If it >= need,\
    \ the eating is not done.\nTo do this, we can use the following formula.\n\n(need/number)\
    \ - (need/number) = number of carrots to eat\n\nSo if we need to eat some carrots,\
    \ we can have (need/number) - carrots to eat. So, we can define the carrots to\
    \ eat as (need/number) - carrots to eat. \nTo find the number of carrots to eat,\
    \ we can just subtract the number of carrots to eat from the number that we have\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThis is a good answer, but it seems very inefficient to me.  It\
    \ looks like you are using two vectors to store the same information (`need` and\
    \ `remaining`).  One method would be to only store the remaining carrots in the\
    \ `remaining` vector and count them up every time `eat(...)` is called and to\
    \ store only the first `need` number of carrots in the `need` vector.  Then you\
    \ could simply compare the two vectors after the call to `eat(...)`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThe two vectors aren't that different, the difference is that I used\
    \ them for two separate purposes in my example.  If you only use one vector and\
    \ add and subtract 1 from it every time it is called, you run into the problem\
    \ of what to do when the first value is greater than the second (as happens in\
    \ `eat(1, 10, 10)`).  The function would have to know that `need` had already\
    \ been used and would need to return `c(need-1, need)` to handle the first call.\
    \  The `need` vector would also have to take into account that the first call\
    \ might have only had `need` left.  There would still be two vectors, one with\
    \ the number of carrots left and one with the number of carrots needed.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nIt seems my comment was confusing.  I meant to say \"I used one\
    \ vector to store the numbers of carrots *left* in my example\".  Since `need`\
    \ and `remaining` are the only vectors being used, there is no need to store the\
    \ carrots left.  Instead, I would just use `remaining`.  However, if the number\
    \ of carrots is limited to 1000, \ntest_humaneval <- function() {\ncandidate <-\
