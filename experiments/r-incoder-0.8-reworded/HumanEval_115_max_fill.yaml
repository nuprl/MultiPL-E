    The minimum spanning tree is spanning tree [2, 5, 1, 3]\nThe diameter of the MST\

    \ is a heuristic algorithm that finds optimal solutions to a problem by trying\
    \ all possible solutions and greedily finding the one that gets stuck first.\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<text>\nBacktracking is used to solve a problem where an algorithm\
    \ that always gives an optimal result might not always do so. For example, the\
    \ travelling salesman problem (TSP) is NP-hard, meaning there is no known polynomial\
    \ time algorithm to find an optimal solution.\n\nBacktracking can be viewed as\
    \ a search algorithm, where you recursively try all possible combinations of paths,\
    \ and at each stage greedily find a path with better solution value. The idea\
    \ is to keep trying smaller paths and greedily try bigger paths.\n\nA recursive\
    \ backtracking algorithm is typically implemented as some form of recursive function\
    \ which takes in current state/path and returns new state/path.\n\nThe code below\
    \ implements a recursive backtracking function that checks if a given node should\
    \ be added to the solution set or not. While adding new nodes to the solution\
    \ set, this function recursively tries all possible path from that node to the\
    \ goal node and adds the nodes to the solution set if that path leads to a higher\
    \ solution value.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "\n  count <- 0\n  for(i in 1:nrow(grid))\

    \ correct. The problem is that you didn't put enough code in your question. I\
    \ don't know what you want `count` to be -- how many times the well can be lowered?\
    \ The number of times the well can be lowered if the bucket is completely empty?\
    \ You need to explain that in more detail. Your code is also quite inefficient.\
    \ `grid[which(grid == 1)] = 0` will take an O(n x m) time, where n is the number\

    \ fill in a grid, you need to find the minimum number of cuts you can make that\
    \ fill the grid. Let's think about how you could do this.\n\nSuppose you have\
    \ a grid of size N. Let's say N is even. Then there are two ways to fill up your\
    \ grid. You can either fill the grid in two or more rows with a single row, or\
    \ fill the grid in two or more columns with a single column. Let's say that you\
    \ have two rows, one column, and N cells. The minimum number of cuts you can make\
    \ is exactly N - 2. The first row and column have N cells each. One way to fill\
    \ this grid in two or more rows is by putting another row of N cells into the\
    \ first row, then one cell into the second row. The second row has one less cell\
    \ than the first, and so on for columns. You would get N - 2 cuts by doing this,\
    \ and this would produce a minimum cuts of N - 2. The same can be said if you\
    \ had three rows, two columns, N cells. You would have N - 3 cuts by doing this.\
    \ Thus, it follows that the minimum number of cuts you can make is a minimum of\
    \ N - 2.\n\nWhat if your grid isn't square? What if each row has more than one\
    \ column? What if each column has more than one row? What if all the rows have\
    \ more than one column and all the columns have more than one row?\n\nWe can still\
    \ use the same method to find the minimum cuts, just by adding more rows and columns\
    \ to your grid. Let's see how that would work.\n\nSuppose that you have four rows\
    \ and three columns. How many minimum cuts would you need to produce a grid with\
    \ exactly 4 rows and 3 columns? Well", "\n  maxcount <- 0\n  for(i in 1:length(grid))\

    \ are a family of search algorithms, where each algorithm searches for a solution\
    \ by considering all the possibilities in multiple turns (without remembering\
    \ what happened before). To be precise, Greedy algorithms explore every single\
    \ possibility in the search space and take the one that has the highest total\
    \ score. Another name for Greedy algorithms is the Knapsack algorithm. \nIn this\
    \ problem, we do not need to remember the whole history, we only need to find\
    \ the optimal solution. We can solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm.\n\

    The question we were asked is this:\n\nGiven a grid of size NxN (where N is any\
    \ positive integer) containing a single water cell and a list of non-water cells,\
    \ find the maximum number of water that can be extracted from each cell in the\
    \ list that would not break the rules for extraction from the water cell. Extraction\
    \ of water from the water cell does not break the rules of extraction from the\
    \ non-water cells.\nThe size of the list is at most 10 and the cells cannot overlap.\n\
    You are allowed to use a bucket to extract water. \nThe buckets have the exact\
    \ same capacity.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nLet's solve this using our previously solved\

    <text>\n6.2 Pruning a Binary Search Tree\nWe know that a binary search tree is\
    \ similar to an AVL tree. Instead of using an AVL tree, we use binary search tree\
    \ to solve this problem. It has the same operations as the AVL tree with the same\
    \ time complexity in $\\mathcal{O}(logN)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in\
    \ the tree. The key difference is that we do not need to traverse all the nodes.\
    \ We only need to traverse the subtree of a node that is equal to the node we\
    \ are pruning. Thus, the operation is $\\mathcal{O}(\\logN/\\logN)$. Here is the\
    \ Python code for pruning a binary search tree.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef pruneBST(root):\n\

    15. Largest Product in a Grid\nYou are given a 2D grid where each cell contains\
    \ a positive integer value.\nYour task is to find the largest product of four\
    \ adjacent cells in the grid.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = \n[\n  [0, 0, 0],\n\
    \  [0, 8, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3]\n]\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: \ngrid[0][0] = 0, grid[0][1]\
    \ = 0, grid[0][2] = 0, so largest product is 0.\ngrid[1][0] = 0, grid[1][1] =\
    \ 8, and grid[1][2] = 0, so the largest product is 8.\ngrid[2][0] = 0, grid[2][1]\
    \ = 0, and grid[2][2] = 3, so the largest product is 3.\nExample 2:\nInput: grid\
    \ = \n[\n  [0, 1, 1],\n  [1, 0, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1]\n]\nOutput: 120\nExplanation:\
    \ \ngrid[0][0] = 0, grid[0][1] = 11, grid[0][2] = 1, so largest product is 0.\n\
    grid[1][0] = 1, grid[1][1] = 11, grid[1][2] = 1, so the largest product is 11.\n\
    grid[2][0] = 1, grid[2][1] = 11, grid[2][2] = 1, so the largest product is 11.\n\

    <text>\n6. Find second minimum cost of a rectangle\nGiven a 2D grid map (represented\
    \ as a list of lists), return its second minimum cost.\nThe cost of a move is\
    \ the difference between the length of the current position and \nthe length of\
    \ the goal position. \nIf the two positions are identical, then the cost is zero.\n\
    \nYou may assume that the cost to reach a position (i, j) is equal to \ncost(i,\
    \ j) - cost(i - 1, j)\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]], and cost = 99\n\
    Output: 3\nExplanation: Second minimum cost is achieved by moving (0, 0) -> (1,\
    \ 0).\nNote:\n\n* The given grid will always be a rectangle, and not necessarily\
    \ square.\n* The cost function will not necessarily be symmetric.\n* You may assume\
    \ that the cost to reach a position (i, j) is equal to \n  cost(i, j) - cost(i\
    \ - 1, j).\nExample:\n\ngrid = [\n   [0,1,1,0],\n   [0,1,1,0],\n   [0,0,0,0]\n\
    ]\ncost = 100\nSolution: Third minimum cost is achieved by moving (0, 0) -> (1,\
    \ 1).\nSolution 3: The minimum cost to reach the goal is 3 + 99 + 99 = 198.\n\n\
    </text>\n<text>\nSolution\nFor this problem,\nwe already know that if the two\
    \ positions are the same then we can just subtract them.\nSo we need a way to\
    \ calculate the two positions.\n\nWe also know that if we want to reach the goal\
    \ position, we need to subtract the cost of moving from the previous positions.\n\
    So we can just make a function where we subtract the cost of moving from all the\
    \ previous positions.\n\nNow we also know that when we subtract the cost of moving\
    \ from a position, we have to take that position out of the equation.\nIf we subtract\
    \ 99 from (100, 99), we actually subtract 99 from (99, 99).\n\nSo we can just\
    \ make our function where it subtracts the cost of moving from all the previous\
    \ positions and then we subtract the cost of moving from the goal position.\n\n\
    We also know that when we subtract a position from a position, it will be subtracted\
    \ both ways, so we can just subtract the cost of moving ", "\n  # Fill wells from\

    \ N rows and M columns. Each row and column represents a station that could be\
    \ filled by some kind of animal. Each animal can only eat up to the capacity of\
    \ the station.\nYou are given a vector capacity that contains the maximum amount\
    \ of each type of animal that could eat each station. The type of animal is represented\
    \ by the following vector:\nvector animal <- c(\"dog\", \"cat\", \"fish\", \"\
    mouse\")\nYou are also given an integer k. You need to find the maximum number\
    \ of animals that could eat each station without using the animal \"mouse\".\n\
    \nA first approach to solve this problem is to use the Dynamic Programming algorithm.\
    \ DP works by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved\
    \ much more efficiently than brute force.\n\nYou can solve this problem efficiently\
    \ and with time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of stations.\n\
    \nLet $s$ be the ith station, then $s_i$ be the maximum number of animals that\
    \ could eat up from station $s$. The value of $s_i$ can be calculated by dynamic\
    \ programming.\n\n$$s_i = \\max \\left{\\begin{array}{l}\n     \n     \\begin{matrix}\n\
    \      1 & \\\n      0 & \\\n      1 & \\\n      0 & \\\n     \\end{matrix}\n\

    \ that it tries to maximize the number of unfilled buckets.  However, the code\
    \ you wrote is buggy: it can cause the entire grid to become `0` or `1`, and it\
    \ won't stop after filling all the buckets.  For your example data, it ends up\

    \ Bath Problem\nA Bell Bounded Bath problem is a stochastic algorithm that uses\
    \ a bounded bell border to represent a bath, and a bounded bath to represent a\
    \ bell. Each bath has m rows (the length of a bell box) and n columns (the length\
    \ of a bath box). Each bath cell is either 0 or 1, and each bell in the grid is\
    \ either 0 or 1. You are given an nXm grid of 0s and 1s, where each 1 represents\
    \ water, and a bath is represented by a bell-bounded bath problem in which the\
    \ bath has a specified capacity and the bell-bounded bath has a specified capacity.\
    \ You should determine the maximum water that can be stored in the bath given\
    \ the constraints of the capacity of the bath and the bell-bounded bath.\nYour\
    \ first part is to write a function that takes a given grid and a capacity.\n",
