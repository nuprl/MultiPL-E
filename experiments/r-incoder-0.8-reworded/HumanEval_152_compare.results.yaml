    \ I understand it now\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=vector,r dscore=0 |>\nA possible solution:\n\
    <code>\ncompare <- function(game, guess) {\n    score <- NULL\n    \n    for (i\
    \ in seq_along(game)) {\n        \n        diff <- abs(game[i] - guess[i])\n \
    \       \n        if(diff < 0)\n            score[i] <- diff\n        \n     \
    \   else\n            score[i] <- 0\n    }\n    \n    score\n}\n\n</code>\n<|/\
    \ a |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nHere is a more vectorized solution. Note how the function\
    \ abs is applied to diff to get absolute differences within each iteration of\
    \ the loop. This makes the code much shorter and faster as well.\n<code>\ncompare\
    \ <- function(game, guess) {\n  score <- abs(guess - game)\n  score\n}\n</code>\n\
    The function above returns an object of type numeric but if you want a vector\
    \ of the same length as your input then you can do:\n<code>\ncompare <- function(game,\
    \ guess) {\n  score <- abs(guess - game)\n  score <- ifelse(score < 0, score,\
    \ 0)\n  score\n}\n</code>\nIf you want the result to always be a vector of length\
    \ length(guess) + 1 then you can use:\n<code>\ncompare <- function(game, guess)\
    \ {\n  score <- abs(guess - game)\n  score <- ifelse(score < 0, score, vector(\"\
    numeric\", length(guess) + 1))\n  score\n}\n</code>\nThe above function can be\
    \ modified to handle differing lengths by wrapping it in an ifelse statement as\
    \ follows:\n<code>\ncompare <- function(game, guess) {\n  if(length(guess) !=\
    \ length(game)) {\n    stop(\"Mismatched lengths between guess and game\")\n \
    \ }\n  score <- abs(guess - game)\n  score <- ifelse(score < 0, score, vector(\"\
    numeric\", length(guess) + 1))\n  score\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=vector,r |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI think you're right, but I wasn't sure. I edited my answer to make it\
    \ clearer\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=vector,r |>\nYou can try this as well:\n\
    <code>\ncompare <- function(game, guess)\n{\n    \ntest_humaneval <- function()\

    \ is not the result of the test case that OP gave.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHmmm. No,\
    \ I ran the OP's code and got `c(0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3)`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI did\
    \ not say that the OP was wrong. Your algorithm is not equivalent to the algorithm\
    \ I presented. Your algorithm returns `c(4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6)` for `compare(c(1,\
    \ 2, 3, 4, 5, 1), c(1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2))`. OP's algorithm returns `c(0, 0, 0, 0,\
    \ 3, 3)` for `compare(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1), c(1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2))`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYou say _\"No, I ran the OP's code and got `c(0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3)`.\"_\
    \ I do not think you did run OP's code. I do not know what `compare` is. We don't\
    \ know the OP's code. Maybe you did not test your code? OP's code runs fine for\
    \ me. It also does not return `c(0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3)`. The OP's code returns `c(4,\
    \ 4, 1, 0, 0, 6)` when asked for `c(4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2)`. If I run the OP's code\
    \ then I get the desired result. Did you run mine?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=r,vector,algorithm\
    \ |>\nYour algorithm is close to optimal.\nHowever, there are some things that\
    \ can speed it up. First, compare is the name of a function in R, so calling it\
    \ like this can cause problems. In general, I recommend using <- instead of <-\
    \ to assign values to a variable (otherwise you can get strange behavior when\
    \ assigning to the same variable twice in the same line).\nSecond, if you don't\
    \ need your function to be generic, you could make it more specific by rewriting\
    \ the for-loop:\n<code>\ncompare <- function(game, guess) {\n    score <- 0\n\
    \    for(i in 1:length(guess)) {\n        score <- score + abs(guess[i] - game[i])\n\
    \    }\n    score\n}\n</code>\nThis should increase the speed dramatically.\n\n\

    Exercise 4: Finding the top player\nYour task is to use the scores of two players\
    \ to help you find the top player of the game (with scores at least as great as\
    \ possible).\nYou want to choose the player with the highest probability of winning,\
    \ and you will be given the following vector of probabilities:\n\np1 <- c(0.6,\
    \ 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)\np2 <- c(0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)\nThe first player has scored 0.6\
    \ of matches, each of which was a win for player 1.\nThe second player has scored\
    \ 0.2 of matches, each of which was a win for player 1.\nThe third player has\
    \ scored 0.2 of matches, each of which was a win for player 2.\nThe fourth player\
    \ has scored 0.2 of matches, each of which was a win for player 2.\nThe probabilities\
    \ do not add up to 1, so they do not add up to the probability of winning the\
    \ game.\nThe probability of winning the game is therefore calculated by adding\
    \ up the probabilities for each player.\n\nThe function will take two inputs,\
    \ the vector of player probabilities and the vector giving the scores. \nReturn\
    \ a vector of the same length as the input giving the best probability of winning\
    \ the game. The highest probability player will be the first element, \nand so\
    \ on.\nIf you can't find the top player, return NA.\n\nexample:\np1 <- c(0.6,\

    \ `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.\n</code>\nNow the error\
    \ tells us that game is of size 12, but only of size 4. We know that we are not\
    \ calling compare on 12 items. We also know that the number of items in the guess\
    \ vector matches the number of items in the game vector. The problem is that one\

    \ guess) {\n    result <- 0\n    for (i in 1:length(guess)){\n        result <-\
    \ result + (guess[i] - game[i])^2\n    }\n    return(result)\n}\n</code>\nThis\
    \ error occurs for every item in the guess vector. By running this function, we\
    \ have confirmed that we are running against the length of each item in the guess\
    \ vector. \nWe would like to see how this works on a single item. Let's say that\

    \ the best meats to eat. There may be multiple solutions. You need to go through\

    \nThe function should take two arguments \u2014 the total cost of eating each\
    \ meal and the cost of eating each meal that you are considering. You can assume\
    \ that all costs are integers and all costs are positive.\n\nThe function should\
    \ return a vector of meals to eat: that is, each element of the vector should\
    \ be the meal with the lowest total cost that you are considering. Your function\
    \ should return a vector of costs, where the ith element is the total cost of\
    \ eating meal i.\n\nThe example below illustrates your problem with this function.\
    \ Let's look at the example meal costs given to you as you go. Meal number 1 costs\
    \ 5, meal number 2 costs 3, and meal number 3 costs 7.\n\nYour function should\
    \ calculate the total cost of eating meal 3, which has a total cost of 14. You\
    \ are considering costs 1, 2, and 3. Your function should return c(5, 3, 7).\n\

    <| c |>\nThanks for your reply. I think the problem is that my function `compare`\
    \ does not know that if two numbers are the same then they are the same and thus\
    \ will return a wrong result as far as I can see. I do know that if two numbers\
    \ are the same then they will have the same score and thus will return a 0 but\

    \ if so how can I tell the function how many matches there are?\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nThe function takes two vectors as arguments and returns a vector.  It\

    \ Functions\nWe have now covered the basics of R and can now start putting our\
    \ code to use. \nWe will start by refactoring our code a bit to get it working.\n\
    This first bit of code will run a simulation in which we generate 2 random numbers\
    \ \nand compare them with the correct answer to determine the accuracy of the\
    \ system.\nTo do this, we will use the rand() function which generates random\
    \ numbers between 0 and 1 (by default).\nFor each iteration of the simulation,\
    \ the rand() function will generate 2 random numbers \nbetween 0 and 1. If these\
    \ numbers are equal, the simulation will end and we will return 1 to the \nsystem.\n\
    This code is a bit messy so don't be surprised if we need to make changes.\nIn\
    \ the future we might want to implement our own generator for random numbers\n\
    rather than use the rand() function.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ntest_humaneval <- function()\
