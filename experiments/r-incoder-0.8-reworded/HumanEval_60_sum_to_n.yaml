    \    comb <- c(comb, list(temp))\n  }\n  return(comb)\n}\n</code>\nFor n=10, we\

    Note that the inner loop of the function has a terminating condition x <= n -\
    \ 1 and a recursive call on the tail of the sequence that begins at x + 1. We\
    \ will refer to this tail as the \"tail of the sequence\" because the recursive\
    \ function will need to use the tail of the sequence as its input, and its output\

    <text>\nThe function works recursively.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nsum_to_n(10)\n</cell>\n\
    <text>\nLet's look at the function again. Notice that it calls itself.\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <cell>\nsum_to_n\n</cell>\n<text>\nWe can now see what it does, by calling the\
    \ function with different values for each of its arguments (that is, the call\
    \ sites).\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nsum_to_n(5)\n</cell>\n<cell>\nsum_to_n(100)\n\
    </cell>\n<cell>\nsum_to_n(20)\n</cell>\n<text>\nWe can see that for values of\
    \ n greater than 20, it keeps returning the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\
    \nThe recursive process is then repeated for a few more values of n, until it\
    \ finally returns 1.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nThis process is called 'iteration'.\
    \ For example, consider the following function:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nfactorial\
    \ <- function(x) {\n  factorial_helper(\n    x,\n    1,\n    1\n  )\n}\n\nfactorial_helper\
    \ <- function(x, n, acc) {\n  if (n == 1) {\n    return(acc)\n  } else {\n   \
    \ return(factorial_helper(\n      x,\n      n - 1,\n      acc * x\n    ))\n  }\n\
    }\n</cell>\n<text>\nThis function computes $x!$, where $x$ is the number that\
    \ it is given.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nfactorial(5)\n</cell>\n<text>\nIt works recursively,\
    \ and at each level of recursion, it calls another function called factorial_helper.\
    \ This function, in turn, calls itself.\n\nA good programming practice is to name\
    \ these functions, so that if anyone wants to read your code, they can quickly\
    \ figure out what they are doing, and how they work. For example, factorial and\
    \ factorial_helper both describe what you are trying to do: compute a factorial\
    \ of a number. Sometimes this will be straightforward, because one function will\
    \ do it, and sometimes it won't, because you need to keep track of the current\
    \ level of recursion.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nExercise\nWrite a function that computes\
    \ the factorial of a number. Call the function factorial and pass it an integer\

    <| a dscore=0 |>\nHere's a recursive function that works for a few numbers up\
    \ to 1,000,000 without hitting the limit.\nIt builds a list of the numbers between\
    \ 1 and n (including n itself) and then counts the number of odd numbers in each\
    \ sublist.  It then sums the odd numbers in a list and returns the list.\n<code>\n\
    count_odd_numbers_recursive<-function(n){\n  if(n <= 1){\n    return(list())\n\
    \  }\n  if(is.null(odds_l)){\n    odds_l <- c(list(0), c())\n  }\n  if(length(odds_l)\
    \ == 1){\n    odds_l[[1]] <- odds_l[[1]] + n\n  }else{\n    odds_l[[1]] <- odds_l[[1]]\
    \ + n\n    count_odd_numbers_recursive(n - 1)\n  }\n  odds_l[[2]] <- odds_l[[2]]\
    \ + n\n  odds_l\n}\n\ncount_odd_numbers_recursive(1000000000)\n", "\n  n <- ifelse(n\

    <|/ a tags=r,integer,sequence,algorithm |>\n<| c |>\nI like this one because it\
    \ uses `nchoosek` which seems useful in other situations. +1 for the recursive\
    \ solution\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursion works fine as long as you don't need\
    \ to find the sum of all numbers from 0 to n. Otherwise this won't work because\
    \ `sum(nchoosek(n, i))` can not be computed without computing all `i`'s up to\
    \ `n` first.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou don't need to compute all `i`'s up to `n`\
    \ first. This is only necessary if you need to find the sum of the numbers up\
    \ to `n-1` but you want to compute `n` first because otherwise you would have\
    \ `i` > `n`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=r,integer,sequence,algorithm |>\nThe answer\
    \ above is correct. However, if you want to calculate the sum of numbers from\
    \ 1 to 100 using recursion, without using nchoosek, then here you go:\n<code>\n\
    sum_to_n <- function(n){\n  if(n <= 1)\n    1 \n  else\n    1 + sum_to_n(n - 1)\n\

    \ in a. Of course, we could have also used a for loop, but since we are interested\
    \ in applying functions over arrays, let us use the map function for it.\n\nIn\
    \ fact, map is also useful for applying functions to vectors of numbers (of any\
    \ dimension). For example, if we want to add 1 to every element in a vector, we\
    \ could have also used a for loop.\n\n\n</text>\n<code language=julia-1.6>\nb\

    \ or i+=1\nend\nb\n</cell>\n<text>\nFinally, map can also accept a tuple as input,\
    \ which is equivalent to applying multiple functions to each element of the tuple:\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<code language=julia-1.6>\na = (1, 2, 3)\nb = (a, sum_to_n(a), sum_to_n(a*a))\n\
    map(b) # or map(b...)\n</cell>\n<text>\nThe map is useful for applying functions\
    \ to other functions. For example, we could have used map to apply the function\
    \ f on every element of the vector a and another function g on every element of\
    \ vector b. If f returns a vector, then we can apply g to each element of this\
    \ vector (hence, using map(f, g) instead of g(f))\n\n\n</text>\n<code language=julia-1.6>\n\
    map(f, g, a)\n</cell>\n<code language=julia-1.6>\nmap(f, g, a, b)\n</cell>\n<text>\n\
    Finally, we can use the reduce function to perform the same operation on a vector.\
    \ For example, we can sum up all the elements in b and then multiply by a:\n\n\
    \n</text>\n<code language=julia-1.6>\nreduce(+, b) * a\n</cell>\n<text>\nNote\
    \ that we did not have to define a function for sum_to_n to perform this operation.\
    \ In fact, the function already exists in Julia because it is one of the most\
    \ popular functions in statistical programming. We can also define a function\
    \ that performs a similar operation on vectors without the use of map:\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <code language=julia-1.6>\nadd_n <- function(x) {\n    sum(x)\n}\n\nreduce(+,\
    \ a) * a\n</cell>\n<text>\nWe can also use the reduce function to solve a more\
    \ general problem. For example, if we want to find all combinations of elements\
    \ of a vector that add up to ", "\n  return(sum(1:n))\n}\n", "\n  n <- n\n  ifelse(n\
    \ == 0, n + 1, n * (n + 1) / 2)\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThank you, this\

    <| a dscore=2 tags=function,r,cumulative-sum |>\nYou can use cumsum:\n<code>\n\

    \ is that it gives a wrong result for n = 1.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks. `sum_to_n(2)`\
    \ gives `0` instead of `2`, but `sum_to_n(3)` gives `1` instead of `3`. Not sure\
    \ why. I suppose it's because `1:n` is `1:2`, and so the second element of `1:2`\
    \ is `1`, and the third element of `", "\n  n <- n + 1\n  seq(n, n)[[which.max(rep_len(TRUE,\
    \ n-1))]]\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nI like your answer because\
    \ it's very readable and I like the `which.max` approach.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1\
    \ tags=r,vector,functional-programming,function |>\nHere's an alternative.  It's\
    \ not as elegant as Roman R's solution, but it's more readable and it doesn't\
    \ use any for loops or vectorization.\n<code>\nsum_to_n <- function(n) {\n  n\
    \ <- n + 1\n  n <- n - 1\n  c(tail(1:n, n - length(n)), head(0:(n + 1), n))\n\
    }\n\nsum_to_n(100)", "\n  sum_n <- 0\n  k <- 1\n  while(k <= n) { sum_n <- sum_n\
    \ + k; k <- k + 1 }\n  sum_n\n}\n</code>\nThe above function uses while loop.\
    \ While loop is a control structure and is used to loop through any amount of\
    \ statements. The statements within the loop are executed until either the loop\
    \ is finished or there is a break statement. For example:\n<code>\nn <- 20\nwhile(n\
    \ != 0) {\n  n <- n - 1\n  print(n)\n}\n</code>\nIn the above code, n will stop\
    \ at 0 and the loop will stop. If I add break statements to the loop like so:\n\
    <code>\nn <- 20\nwhile(n != 0) {\n  n <- n - 1\n  print(n)\n  if(n > 0) break;\n\
    }\n</code>\nThe loop will stop once it reaches 0.\nIn R language, we can also\
    \ use the if and else statement to do conditional execution.\n<code>\nn <- 20\n\
    while(n != 0) {\n  n <- n - 1\n  print(n)\n  if(n > 0) break;\n}\n</code>\nIf\
    \ n > 0 it will break the loop and continue with the rest of statements.\nAnother\
    \ way of implementing the sum_to_n function is to use the accumulate function\
    \ from purrr package:\n<code>\nsum_to_n <- function(n) {\n  accumulate(1:n, sum)\n\
    }\n</code>\nYou can see that accumulate function takes two arguments, the starting\
    \ value and the function to compute the next value.\n<|/ a tags=loops,r |>\n<|\

    \ loop in Python. You can find more details about those functions in the following\

    This function is pretty straight forward, but we can do better with a more advanced\

    \ and get groceries\nI buy groceries\nI try to buy more groceries\nI fail\nI try\
    \ again and I succeed\n\nThe above example is recursive.\n\nA recursive function\
    \ is a function that is defined inside itself (i.e., a function within a function).\n\
    \nThe base case is when the problem can be solved using recursion alone. For example,\

    \ <- function(n) {\n\tif(n == 0)\n\t\t1\n\telse\n\t\tn * factorial(n - 1)\n}\n\
    </cell>\n<text>\nThe recursive case is when the function calls itself (i.e., calls\
    \ itself).\n\nIn the above example, the function factorial calls itself to solve\
    \ the problem with 1 as its argument.\n\nThe process of solving a problem using\
    \ recursion is called recursion.\n\nA recursive function is a function that is\
