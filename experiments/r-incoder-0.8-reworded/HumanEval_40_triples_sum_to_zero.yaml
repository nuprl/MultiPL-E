    \ two design patterns show up in many R codes: Singletons and Strategy patterns.\
    \ You may recognize the Strategy pattern as one of the main patterns in OOP. The\
    \ Singleton pattern is the one that most frequently appears in OOP. R is a language\
    \ for data manipulation. R's OOP capabilities are somewhat limited. In general,\
    \ data manipulation is done through functions. A function that performs one single\
    \ function of its parameter is called a \"Function\". Functions usually take one\
    \ or more arguments and return one value. The following are examples of functions\
    \ that manipulate data:\n\nsum() - adds up a list of numbers. \nlog() - takes\
    \ an argument and returns the natural logarithm of it. \nsample() - takes an argument\
    \ and returns a random sample from it. \nsort() - sorts data using a user-defined\
    \ function. It takes one argument (a list of numbers).\ntable() - creates a two-dimensional\
    \ character array. \n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nDesign Pattern Singleton Pattern\nIn\
    \ OOP, there exists a notion of class hierarchies. For example, a class hierarchy\
    \ of animals could be Animal, Dog, Cat and Lion. The Lion, Dog and Cat classes\
    \ inherit the Animal class. In the Lion, Dog and Cat classes, a method called\
    \ speak would be defined. Each animal class has a method called speak. Animal\
    \ is the parent class of Dog, Cat and Lion. Dog and Cat also inherit the Animal\
    \ class.\n\nThe singleton pattern is a design pattern that allows a class to be\
    \ initialized only once and be shared through out the class hierarchy. A singleton\
    \ pattern is also known as the strategy pattern. The most common singleton pattern\
    \ is the Singleton class. Singletons usually have only one instance and are often\
    \ called static. Singletons usually have only one instance and are often called\
    \ static. Singletons usually have only one instance and are often called static.\

    <text>\n6. Slicing vectors.\nLet's now look at some examples of vector slicing.\n\
    \n6.1 Using \"[\" with single indexing.\nRemember that vectors in R are just special\
    \ ordered lists. A vector is a list whose elements are of length one (so called\
    \ atomic vectors).\n\n6.1.1 The \"[\" operator.\nThe \"[\" operator can be used\
    \ to extract elements from a vector. For example, if we want to extract the first\
    \ two elements of a vector \"v\", we do \"v[1]\" and \"v[2]\". The two outputs\
    \ correspond to the first two elements of the vector \"v\".\n\n6.1.2 Indexing\
    \ vectors.\nWe can use \"[\" to index a vector with a vector of indexes of length\
    \ equal to the number of elements in the vector. Let's see some examples.\n\n\
    6.1.1.1 Extracting elements with a single index.\nSuppose we have a vector \"\
    v\" with elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nWe extract the first two elements\
    \ with \"v[1]\" and \"v[2]\".\n\nThe two outputs correspond to the first two elements\
    \ of the vector \"v\". \"v[1]\" gives us the first element of vector \"v\", and\
    \ \"v[2]\" gives us the second element of vector \"v\".\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>",

    \ = FALSE)\n    if(length", "\n  sum(sapply(l, function(x){\n    sum(x != 0) -\
    \ (x == 0)\n  }) == 3)\n}\n</code>\nAnd here is the other approach I mentioned\
    \ that takes advantage of the fact that there will only be 3 distinct elements\
    \ in the list that sum to 0:\n<code>", "\n  # The below is the only change from\
    \ the original function\n  sum(unique(c(l)) == 3)\n}\n", "\n  length(unique(unlist(lapply(l,\
    \ sum))) == 3L\n}\n</cell>\n<cell>", "\n  v1 <- sort(l)\n  v2 <- sort(l)\n  v3\

    \ {\n      return (TRUE)\n    }\n    i <- i + 1\n  }\n  return (FALSE)\n}\n</code>\n\
    The above function takes a list of integers, sorts it in ascending order, and\
    \ then runs a sum-to-zero test on it for all the possible three adjacent elements.\
    \ When that test returns TRUE, we're done. If it returns FALSE, we add 1 to i\
    \ (to point to the next element in the list) and run the same test on the new\
    \ list. We do this until we get to the end of the list. Then, if after running\
    \ this test there are still any remaining elements in the list, the function returns\
    \ FALSE. If there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, then\
    \ the function returns TRUE.\n<|/ a dscore=3 |>\n<| c |>\nThe question also mentions\

    Nice idea.  I ended up doing something quite similar, just using `rle` instead\

    \ the input vector, then finds the sum of the elements and calculates the sum\
    \ of the absolute differences between them (which is how we know whether there\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Agreed, but that was not the OP's problem -- so I didn't\

    \ the detailed answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis is really good answer but i think\
    \ that OP will have to define his own function and i don't think that there is\
    \ anything in R like `any` or `all` but you still can use `any` or `all` on vector\
    \ of TRUE/FALSE\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think that `any` and `all` are more of a\
    \ performance concern. `%in%` should be faster.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2 tags=r\

    \ zero, all you need is\n<code>\nany(x == 0)\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| a tags=r |>\n\
    Here's another approach - using a functional approach:\n<code>\nanyZero<-function(a)\
    \ return(any(a==0))\n</code>\nNow if you want to know if any values are equal\
    \ to zero, you can use it like this:\n<code>\n> anyZero(c(1,0,2))\n[1] FALSE\n\
    </code>\nYou can apply it on any vector:\n<code>\n> anyZero(c(1,0,2))\n[1] FALSE\n\
    > anyZero(c(1,0,0))\n[1] TRUE\n</code>\nThis doesn't really change the concept\
    \ of using any(), and works well in functional approaches, although I'm not sure\
    \ it's particularly efficient. I'm sure some benchmarking would be needed to see\
    \ if it really is faster.\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| a tags=r |>\nAs per my understanding\
    \ you can use the %in% operator to check if a vector is contained in another vector.\n\

    \ |>\n<| a |>\nHere's one way to do it:\n<code>\n> any(c(1,0,0) %in% c(1,0,2))\n\

    \ is an another solution in base R:\n<code>", "\n  if (length(l) == 3) return(TRUE\

    \ 0\n    }))\n  } else\n    FALSE\n}\n</code>\nFinally, we can make a list to\
    \ feed to the function above:\n<code>\ntriple_list <- list(c(1, 3, 5, 0), c(2,\

    \ they don't require much understanding of R. My experience has been that most\

    \ might feel strongly distracted by this challenge and lose the interest of their\

    \ would be considered idiomatic.\n<|/ a dscore=3 |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with. The\
    \ problem is this does not actually answer the question, since OP already said\
    \ they already knew how `rle works`, and it is true that rle's solution is very\
    \ similar to the one I came up with. But they have not asked for the exact solution,\
    \ they just asked if they knew the solution they were looking for, which I do.\
    \ Also, using `ifelse` is probably not the best option here; a solution using\
    \ `ifelse` would be `cumsum(with(rle, table(myList))$lengths>=2)`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI don't know the R language well enough to answer \"Is there a `rle`\
    \ function that solves this problem elegantly?\". But I do think I like the idea\
    \ of solving the problem with `rle` more (+1). My experience with `rle` has also\
    \ been that it can often be easier to understand than solutions using `ifelse`.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think I agree with you: when thinking about the problem in\
    \ this way, it is easy for me to see the solution (using rle in the right way),\
    \ and also remember that it is pretty commonly used in R. So I'm glad that the\
    \ solutions I come up with are also pretty commonly used.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    +1 for the effort, but I still think `rle` might be the right tool for solving\
    \ the problem in this case. The problem with `ifelse` here is that it uses `lengths`\
    \ to count the number of occurrences of different values, and `lengths` gives\
    \ the length of the *whole vector* that contains the different values. But `rle`\
    \ gives only the length of the longest run; `rle(c(-2, -1, 1, 0, 1))` returns\
    \ 1, whereas `rle(c(-2, -1, 1, 0, 1))$lengths` returns 4.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Good point, I forgot about that. Though I suspect that in ", "\n  l <- sort(l,\
