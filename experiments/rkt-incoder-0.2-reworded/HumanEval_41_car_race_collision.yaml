prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely\
  \ long line.\n;; n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different\
  \ set of n cars\n;; are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out\
  \ being very far from\n;; each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars\
  \ are said to collide\n;; when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's\
  \ moving right to left.\n;; However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong;\
  \ as a result, they continue moving\n;; in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\
