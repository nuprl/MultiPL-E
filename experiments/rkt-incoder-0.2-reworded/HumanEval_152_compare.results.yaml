    </code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm still struggling to understand\
    \ how this works. I understand that `compare` will compare the two lists and return\
    \ a list with the differences. But how does it know to compare the two lists based\
    \ on the `diff` value? Also, how does it know to compare the two lists based on\
    \ the `diff` value? I understand that `diff` will hold the difference between\
    \ the two lists, but how does it know to compare the two lists based on the `diff`\
    \ value?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe `diff` value is calculated based on the `diff`\
    \ value returned by the recursive call. `diff` is then compared to `0` to determine\
    \ if the two lists are equal. If they are equal, the `diff` value is returned\
    \ as the result of the recursive call. If they are not equal, the `diff` value\
    \ is calculated based on the difference between the `guess` value and the `score`\
    \ value at the corresponding index in the `game` list. `diff` is then compared\
    \ to `0` to determine if the two lists are equal. If they are equal, the `diff`\
    \ value is returned as the result of the recursive call. If they are not equal,\
    \ the `diff` value is calculated based on the difference between the `guess` value\
    \ and the `score` value at the corresponding index in the `game` list. `diff`\
    \ is then compared to `0` to determine if the two lists are equal. If they are\
    \ equal, the `diff` value is returned as the result of the recursive call. If\
    \ they are not equal, the `diff` value is calculated based on the difference between\
    \ the `guess` value and the `score` value at the corresponding index in the `game`\
    \ list. `diff` is then compared to `0` to determine if the two lists are equal.\
    \ If they are equal, the `diff` value is returned as the result of the recursive\
