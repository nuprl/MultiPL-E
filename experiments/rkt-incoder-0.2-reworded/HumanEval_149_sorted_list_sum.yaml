prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n\
  ;; deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n;; and returns the resulted\
  \ list with a sorted order,\n;; The list is always a list of strings and never a\
  \ list of numbers,\n;; and it may contain duplicates.\n;; The order of the list\
  \ should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n;; should return the list\
  \ sorted by that rule.\n;; If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n\
  ;; The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n;; You may assume\
  \ that all words will have the same length.\n;; For example:\n;; >>> (list_sort\

    \ are the same length. But the strings are different lengths, so the comparison\
