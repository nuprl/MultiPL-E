prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; I think we all remember that feeling when the result of\
  \ some long-awaited\n;; event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have\
  \ at that moment are\n;; definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n;; Your task\
  \ is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n\
  ;; You are given two lists of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index\
  \ shows a match. \n;; Return a list of the same length denoting how far off each\
  \ guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n;; the value is 0, and if not, the\
  \ value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n;; example:\n\
  ;; >>> (compare (list 1 2 3 4 5 1) (list 1 2 3 4 2 -2))\n;; (list 0 0 0 0 3 3)\n\
  ;; >>> (compare (list 0 5 0 0 0 4) (list 4 1 1 0 0 -2))\n;; (list 4 4 1 0 0 6)\n\
