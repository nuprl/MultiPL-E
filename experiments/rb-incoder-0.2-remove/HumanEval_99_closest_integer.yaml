prompt: "# Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n#\
  \ and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant\n# from two\
  \ integers, round it away from zero.\n# Examples\n# Note:\n# Rounding away from\
  \ zero means that if the given number is equidistant\n# from two integers, the one\
  \ you should return is the one that is the\n# farthest from zero. For example closest_integer(\"\
  14.5\") should\n# return 15 and closest_integer(\"-14.5\") should return -15.\n\
