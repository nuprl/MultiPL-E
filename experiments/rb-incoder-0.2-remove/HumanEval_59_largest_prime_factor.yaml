    I like your solution, but I believe it can be optimized a bit. For example, you\
    \ can start from i = 2 and increment it by 2 until you find a factor greater than\
    \ or equal to n. Then, instead of checking if n % factor == 0, you can check if\
    \ n % i == 0. This will save you a lot of time because you won't have to check\
    \ all factors up to n.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, that's a good idea. I didn't think\
