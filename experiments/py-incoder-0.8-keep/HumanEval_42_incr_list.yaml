    \ for a large list. It builds a list in memory and adds each element one by one\
    \ to the list. There is also no reason to make the function `incr_list` a generator.\
    \ It will work equally well as a normal function returning `[...]+[...]` rather\
    \ than `yield [...]`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: That's true, but I didn't want to\
    \ make any assumptions about what the OP's actual use case is (that is, what will\
    \ cause the list to actually be modified).\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2 tags=list,python-3.x,python\
    \ |>\nYou can use list comprehension:\n<code>\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> [i*2-1\
    \ for i in a]\n[2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code>\nIn your example:\n<code>\n>>> [i for i in\
    \  range(5)]\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> [i for i in  range(5)] * 2\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\
    \ 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nBut what if I want to change\
    \ the original list ?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt will return a copy of your list.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis doesn't change the original list, it creates a new list\
    \ with the result of the multiplication\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis is more efficient,\
    \ but as you can see from the comments, it does not change the original list.\
    \ Maybe it does change the original list if the `*2-1` part is replaced with `+1`,\
    \ but then this only works if you only have positive numbers in your list. Try\
    \ it with your example and you'll see that it doesn't work. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nYeah I agree, I just wrote it this way to make the point clear that the\
    \ answer is not changing the original list. I agree, my answer is not very general\
    \ and efficient. I also agree about +1 which only works in positive cases.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nIn response to the OP's comment about efficiency, a\
    \ more efficient way is to make a new list and append the elements of an original\
    \ list to the new list, then return it. This method has O(N) time complexity and\
    \ O(1) space complexity. Here is a short example:\n<code>", "    if len(l) ==\
