prompt: "def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's\
  \ a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;\

    Part Three\nIn this part, you should write the function intersections.\n\nThe\
    \ intersections function should take in the two sorted lists sorted by increasing\
    \ starting time, and a third parameter t, which is the minimum time interval between\
    \ any two cars.\nThe function should return a sorted list that includes the cars\
    \ that collide with each other, and the times at which each of those cars collide\
    \ with each other.\n\nFor example, given a sorted list sorted by starting time,\
    \ and a time parameter t of 0.1, the intersections function should return the\
    \ following two elements:\n\n[10, 30], [10, 40], [10, 50], [10, 60]\n\n</text>\n\
