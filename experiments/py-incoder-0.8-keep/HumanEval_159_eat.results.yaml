    \ I am new to python and was trying to solve this question. I understand that\
    \ it is necessary to have a condition where 'number' >= 'need' but I was struggling\
    \ to understand how this condition will work in practice. Can you please point\
    \ me to an example where 'number' >= 'need' is satisfied.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I have added the function to the original post\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: you can also\
    \ use the ternary operator to simplify the code: `[number - need] + [(number -\
    \ need) if number >= need else 0 for need...]`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, no problem.\
    \ Glad I could help. Feel free to accept the answer if you have helped you\n<|/\

    \ is one named \"numpy\" that has a lot of functionalities to deal with arrays\
    \ and vectors.\nHere is a nice article on how it can be used.\nHere is a simple\
    \ example on how to do what you want with numpy.\n<code>\nimport numpy as np\n\
