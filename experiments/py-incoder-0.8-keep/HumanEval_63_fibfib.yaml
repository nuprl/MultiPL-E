    \ Sequence and Implementation\nThe Fibonacci Sequence is one of the most important\
    \ and important parts of modern mathematics. It is the basis of the analysis of\
    \ mathematical relations - such as equality and inequality. Computing Fibonacci\
    \ numbers is an important tool in solving all kinds of mathematical problems.\
    \ There are multiple ways to compute Fibonacci numbers, but some of them are much\
    \ more efficient than others. For example, one way to compute Fibonacci numbers\
    \ is to consider the following recursive function:\n\nfib(0) = 0\nfib(1) = 1\n\
    fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).\n\nThis function is very efficient because it uses\
    \ the following rules:\n\nRecursive functions have an exit rule - which means\
    \ that if they reach an exit point (a number less than zero, zero, or a number\
    \ greater than or equal to zero), they stop. They then move on to the next function\
    \ call.\nRecursive functions have a base case - which means that they start by\
    \ calling the base case function and move on to the function body if the base\
    \ case is met.\nThe recursive function calls itself three times. The first two\
    \ times it does so by calling the base case function. The third time it makes\
    \ a recursive call. These recursive calls go back up the stack to their base case,\
    \ and then the base case function makes a recursive call again. This repeats until\
    \ the function stops making recursive calls.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is one\
    \ of the most important and most common sequences used in the computer science\
    \ research. It is also one of most important and important algorithms used in\
    \ many other areas. Remember that the Fibonacci sequence is defined as:\n\nfibfib(n)\
    \ == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence grows\
    \ very quickly, so there are a lot of efficient ways to compute it, such as the\
    \ recursive function above. This is the fastest method of computing Fibonacci\
    \ numbers known. Another interesting way to compute Fibonacci numbers is by implementing\
    \ the Fibonacci sequence using recursion:\n\nfibfib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).\n\
    \nIn this case, the base case fib(n) == 0 and does not make any recursive calls.\
    \ So you only need to call fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) once.\n\nA recursive function\
    \ can be very powerful and flexible in the way that it can handle large or complex\
    \ computations. The recursive function fibfib(n) above can handle a very large\

    \ Fibonacci sequence from above with a slightly different implementation\nThe\

    \ exponentially, i.e. it would quickly grow as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. The following\
    \ improvement revisits the previous function implementation by computing the value\
    \ of $f{n-2}$ only once for $f_2$, and for $f{n-1}$ only once for $f_1$.\n\n\n\
