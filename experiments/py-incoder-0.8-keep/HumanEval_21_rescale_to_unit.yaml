    </code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nHm, I was just wondering why you chose to `enumerate`\
    \ the list. Could you comment on that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used enumerate to\
    \ give the index so I can use it to find the min and max in the next step of the\
    \ process.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand your reasoning and I see why you wrote\
    \ that code. But I still do not understand why you chose the code you did. Please\
    \ note that I did not downvote your answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI chose to enumerate,\
    \ just in case you want to use them later on. \nAs far as I understand it, the\
    \ reason is that for that purpose I need to have the index of the current value\
    \ (the enumerate variable in this case) and this makes the code easier to read\
    \ (you just need to look at the line where I set mini and maxi and you know which\
    \ one is the min and which one is the max) and it's also easy to read by other\
    \ people.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI did not downvote either, but I wanted to understand\
    \ your reasoning. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=arrays,python,numpy,mathematical-optimization\
