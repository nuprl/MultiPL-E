    </cell>\n<text>\n3. Longest Subsequence Problem\nThe longest subsequence is the\
    \ longest sequence of elements that appear in some sequence multiple times, at\
    \ least as many times as in some other sequence. For example, \"AABB\" is the\
    \ longest subsequence of the string \"AAABBBCCCCC\", since \"AABB\" is contained\
    \ 3 times both in \"AAABBBCCCCC\" and \"CCCCC\" but 4 times only in \"AAABBBCCCCC\"\
    .\n\nThe subsequence function takes in a sequence and an index, and returns a\
    \ list of indexes of all the subsequences starting at the given index. For example,\
    \ if the sequence is \"ABABB\", and our index is 1, the function will return [1,2,2].\
    \ We will need to return the longest subsequence for the whole list, and we will\
    \ need a list of indexes to keep track of which subsequences we have already encountered.\n\
    \nYour task is to use the subsequence function to find the longest subsequence\
    \ for the whole string. We've already done the coding to find longest subsequence\
    \ for the whole string, so we'll only need to worry about the implementation of\
    \ the subsequence function.\n\nThere are two ways to implement a subsequence function.\
    \ You can either use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string,\
    \ tracking the current starting index and current subsequence, or you can use\
    \ a more functional approach where you use filter to extract all the subsequences\
    \ of the string, and then use max to find the longest subsequence of the extracted\
    \ subsequences. Implement whichever approach is more efficient for your purposes.\n\
