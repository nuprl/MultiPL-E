    \ it returns `[1, 9, 27, 65, 121, 257, 1025]`. This doesn't satisfy the requirement\
    \ that the odd numbers are in collatz sequence. In fact, even numbers in the sequence\
    \ should be the multiples of 3 less than the number, and odd numbers should be\
    \ the multiples of 3 more than the number. Your method returns odd-numbered numbers\
    \ in collatz sequence.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat's a good observation, I guess\

    We can use the function above to solve the Collatz problem on a small scale. The\
    \ Collatz conjecture states that no matter what initial integer n you choose,\
    \ Collatz(n) will always reach 1. For any n, the Collatz conjecture can be tested\

    \ n value by 1 until it reaches 1, and counts the number of steps it took to reach\
    \ 1.\n\nExercise: write a function called get_odd_collatz_times that given a positive\
    \ integer n, returns the number of steps it took to reach 1 with Collatz(n) starting\
    \ with n.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(14)\
