    It also returns an empty list when the second return statement is reached and\
    \ the number is not greater than or equal to zero. Here it checks whether the\
    \ number is greater than or equal to the need, if it is then it returns the array\

    \ me. Sorry if it is a stupid question. I am new to python and was trying to solve\
    \ this question. I understand that it is necessary to have a condition where 'number'\
    \ >= 'need' but I was struggling to understand how this condition will work in\
    \ practice. Can you please point me to an example where 'number' >= 'need' is\
    \ satisfied.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI have added the function to the original post\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: you can also use the ternary operator to simplify the code:\
    \ `[number - need] + [(number - need) if number >= need else 0 for need...]`\n\
