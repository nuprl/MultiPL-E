prompt: "/// Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers\
  \ in collatz sequence.\n/// The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics\
  \ that concerns a sequence defined\n/// as follows: start with any positive integer\
  \ n. Then each term is obtained from the \n/// previous term as follows: if the\
  \ previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n/// the previous term. If\
  \ the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n/// term plus\
  \ 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always\
  \ reach 1.\n/// Note: \n/// 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n/// 2. returned list sorted in\
  \ increasing order.\n/// For example:\n/// get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The\
  \ collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1,\
  \ and 5.\n/// >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n/// vec![1, 5]\nfn get_odd_collatz(n: isize)\
