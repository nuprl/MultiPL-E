I'm thinking of using a recursive function, but I'm not sure how to implement it.\n\n\nA:\n\nI think you're on the right track.  You can use a recursive function to solve this problem.  The base case is when <code>n</code> is 1.  In that case, there are <code>m</code> possible sequences.  When <code>n</code> is 2, there are <code>m</code> possible sequences of length 1, and for each of those sequences, there are <code>m</code> possible sequences of length 2.  So the total number of sequences of length 2 is <code>m * m</code>.  For <code>n</code> greater than 2, you can use a recursive call to find the number of sequences of length <code>n - 1</code>, and then for each of those sequences, you can add a number from <code>2 * (last element of sequence)</code> to <code>m</code>.  So the total number of sequences of length <code>n</code> is <code>m * (number of sequences of length n - 1)</code>.\n",
