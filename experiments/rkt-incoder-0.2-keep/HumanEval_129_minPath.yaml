prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a\
  \ positive integer k, \n;; each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer\
  \ in the range [1, N * N]\n;; inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the\
  \ grid.\n;; You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n\
  ;; from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n\
  ;; in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n;;\
  \ cell.\n;; Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n\
  ;; necessarily distinct).\n;; You CANNOT go off the grid.\n;; A path A (of length\
  \ k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n;; after making the ordered\
  \ lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n;; through (let's call them\
  \ lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n;; than lst_B, in other words,\
  \ there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n;; such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i]\
  \ and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n;; lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n;; It is guaranteed\
  \ that the answer is unique.\n;; Return an ordered list of the values on the cells\
  \ that the minimum path go through.\n;; Examples:\n;; Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6],\
  \ [7,8,9]], k = 3\n;; Output: [1, 2, 1]\n;; Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]],\
  \ k = 1\n;; Output: [1]\n(define (minPath grid k)\n"
