    \    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a\
    \ number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal\
    \ length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length\
    \ denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the\
    \ value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess\

    \    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a\
