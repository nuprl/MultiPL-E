    \ answer. Can you please explain why you used the $key => $value syntax? I understand\
    \ that it is used to iterate through an array, but why is it used here?\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThe `foreach` loop will iterate through each element in the `$game`\
    \ array and assign the element to the `$key` variable and the element to the `$value`\
    \ variable. The `$key` variable will hold the index of the element in the `$game`\
    \ array and the `$value` variable will hold the value of the element. So in the\
    \ first iteration of the loop `$key` will hold the index `0` and `$value` will\
    \ hold the value of the element at index `0`. In the second iteration `$key` will\
    \ hold the index `1` and `$value` will hold the value of the element at index\
    \ `1`. And so on...\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see, thank you very much. I am still\
