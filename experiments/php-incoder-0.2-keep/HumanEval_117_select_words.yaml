    \ I understand it better now. One thing I noticed is that it only returns words\
    \ that have a length of exactly $n. Is there a way to make it return words that\
    \ have a length of exactly $n and also contain $n? So for example, if the string\
    \ was \"Mary had a little lamb\" and the $n was 3, it would return [\"Mary\",\
    \ \"lamb\"]\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I added a comment to the code explaining\
