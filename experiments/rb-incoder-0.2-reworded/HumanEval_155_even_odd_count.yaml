    Yes, I know. That's why I posted this answer. He asked how to find the number\
    \ of digits in a number. He didn't ask how to find the number of even and odd\

    \ the even and odd digits. I posted this answer because I thought it would be\
    \ helpful to him and I thought it would be helpful to others who are searching\
