    <| c |>\nThanks for your answer! I understand your solution, but I still don't\

    Thank you for your answer! I really appreciate it! I understand your code, but\
    \ I still don't understand how it works. I understand that `music_string.split(\"\
    \ \").map do |note|` splits the string into an array of strings. But how does\
    \ `note.split(\"|\").map do |beats|` work? I understand that `note.split(\"|\"\
    )` splits the string into an array of strings, but how does `note.split(\"|\"\
    ).map do |beats|` work?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`note.split(\"|\")` returns an array\
    \ of strings. `note.split(\"|\").map do |beats|` iterates over each string in\
    \ the array returned by `note.split(\"|\")` and for each string it splits it into\
    \ an array of strings. Each string in the array returned by `note.split(\"|\"\
    )` has one element - the beats string. `note.split(\"|\").map do |beats|` iterates\
    \ over each string in the array returned by `note.split(\"|\")` and for each string\
    \ it splits it into an array of strings. Each string in the array returned by\
    \ `note.split(\"|\")` has one element - the beats string. `note.split(\"|\").map\
    \ do |beats|` iterates over each string in the array returned by `note.split(\"\
