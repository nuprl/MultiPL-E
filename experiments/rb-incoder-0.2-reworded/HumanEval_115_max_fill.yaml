    </cell>\n<text>\nSolution\nLet's see how we solve this problem. First, we need\
    \ to define the grid and the buckets. We will use an Array for our grid. An Array\
    \ is a collection of objects that can store any type of objects. In this case,\
    \ our grid is an array of arrays. Each row in the grid is an array, and each column\
    \ is a separate array in the grid. Let's see how we can create our grid.", " \

    Backtracking is a technique for solving problems where the solution space is too\
    \ large for our computer's memory. Backtracking is a recursive algorithm that\
    \ searches for a solution to an optimization problem by trying smaller variations\
    \ of the problem until it finds a solution. Backtracking can be thought of as\
    \ a way to solve the problem by trying every possible variation of the problem\
