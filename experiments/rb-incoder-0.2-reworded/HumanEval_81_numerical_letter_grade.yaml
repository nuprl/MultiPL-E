prompt: "# It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades\n\
  # to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.\n# The\
  \ only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.\n# She has given\
  \ you an array of GPAs for some students and you have to write \n# a function that\
  \ can output an array of letter grades using the following table:\n# GPA       |\
  \    Letter grade\n# 4.0                A+\n# > 3.7                A \n# > 3.3 \
