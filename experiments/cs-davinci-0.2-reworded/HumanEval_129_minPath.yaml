  \ Problem {\n    // Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive\
  \ integer k, \n    // each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the\
  \ range [1, N * N]\n    // inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\
  \    // You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n\
  \    // from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n\
  \    // in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n\

  \ k cells (not\n    // necessarily distinct).\n    // You CANNOT go off the grid.\n\
