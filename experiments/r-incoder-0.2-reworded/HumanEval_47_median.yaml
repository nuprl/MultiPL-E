    \ and `NA` from the global environment. `NA` from the global environment is usually\
    \ preferred, but sometimes `return(NA)` is necessary (e.g., when you want to return\
    \ `NA` from a function and have it be `NA` from the global environment).\n<|/\

    \ be confused with the `NA` value from the global environment. `return(NA)` makes\
