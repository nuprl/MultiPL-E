    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2 |>\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that you might\
    \ want to use an iterative method rather than a recursive one. \nThe iterative\
    \ method would involve a loop that would repeatedly apply the function to the\
    \ last element of the vector and append the result to the beginning of the vector.\
    \ \nThe recursive method would involve the function being applied to the last\
    \ element of the vector and appending the result to the beginning of the vector.\
    \ \nThe iterative method would look something like this:\n<code>\nf <- function(x)\
    \ {\n  y <- x\n  for(i in 1:length(x)) {\n    y <- c(y[1], f(x[-i]))\n  }\n  y\n\
    }\n</code>\nThe recursive method would look something like this:\n<code>\nf <-\
    \ function(x) {\n  y <- x\n  for(i in 1:length(x)) {\n    y <- c(y[1], f(x[-i]))\n\
    \  }\n  y\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=r,polynomials,derivative |>\n<| c |>\nI like\
