    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: No problem! But I did have one problem: I made a mistake\
    \ with the collision count calculation.  I fixed it now; please try it again.\
    \  The collision count is now correct.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: It would be great\
    \ if you could select this as the answer if it worked for you.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nYes, I will in 2 minutes.  It won't let me for a little while.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 |>\nThis is an interesting problem, but one that might take some\
    \ time to get all the details right.  So let me give you a few hints:\n\nThis\
    \ looks like a dynamic programming problem to me, so you can probably do this\
    \ with memoization (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).  You might have\
    \ to modify your code to store the values in a data structure other than a global\
    \ variable, so that you know when you have to recalculate the current state.\n\
    It looks like you might want to be looking for pairs of cars with similar starting\
    \ locations.  A good way to do this would be to find the closest pair of cars\
    \ (where closest means within a certain distance of eachother).  You could do\
    \ this by sorting the cars by starting location, then finding the closest pair\
    \ (the first pair with the smallest starting location will be the closest one).\
    \  Once you find the first pair, you don't need to keep looking through the rest\
    \ of the cars -- you know the first pair will have the right pair as the second\
    \ car in the list.\n<|/ a tags=php,javascript |>\n<| c |>\nI really appreciate\
    \ the answer! I looked into memoization a bit and I think my problem is that I\
    \ have no idea how to implement it, and I can't seem to find any documentation\
    \ for doing it outside of C#. I'm going to try to find a good tutori\nfunction\

    \ |>\nThank you for your answer. I am not looking for a complete solution but\
    \ a small and simple one like \"The car race will never finish, because there\
    \ are infinitely many possible trajectories for a car to pass through\". As you\
    \ said \"The cars start out being very far from each other. \" But I have also\
    \ read that the real world is quite a difficult world. How do you think this problem\
    \ can be solved ?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's possible to solve a difficult problem,\
    \ but only by brute force. It may take an hour or more for PHP to find a solution\
    \ that can be solved within reasonable time. (You would have to try all possible\
    \ combinations of cars moving one way, and all other possible combinations of\
    \ cars moving another way.)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAnd how do you know that there\
    \ is a solution ? Because there are infinite ways for it to happen.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nAs I said in my answer, there is a mathematical proof that there will\
    \ always be some solution. Not every math problem can be solved in reasonable\
    \ time; this is math. With that proof, we can just try all possible solutions.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with you that there is mathematical proof. But you\
    \ see that there are many things that can make that proof \"unprovable\", and\
    \ therefore it seems that there is a simple and fast solution for that problem.\n\

    \ one with cars colliding. But I think you might need to add conditions to your\
    \ if statement that check if it already crossed the left or right boundary of\
    \ \"line\", since in that case you can't go anywhere anyway\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    This is not correct.  You assume that cars move in the opposite direction, so\
    \ cars would have to move to hit each other in the positive x direction, whereas\
    \ they could be moving in the positive y direction and hit each other in the negative\
    \ x direction.  However, as far as I can tell, you can't get away from that because\
    \ once you get to the x boundary, you can't go anywhere in the negative x direction,\
    \ so there must be some other car in the positive x direction that you can get\
    \ to.  So my answer is wrong.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I have updated my solution\
    \ to include a check for that case.  Thanks for the feedback.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nI thought the question was about a pure race condition where cars have to\
    \ avoid other cars moving in the opposite direction. Like a car in a race where\
