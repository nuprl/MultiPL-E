    \ 3 loops (`while` loops) to solve this problem, because there are only two possible\
    \ outcomes (either the meal is eaten or it is not). You can solve this problem\
    \ with a single `if` statement. Moreover, your solution does not return an array.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt does not require 3 loops and it returns array. It does require\
    \ 2 loops, but it can do it with only one. But my solution does require 2 loops.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYour solution does not use 2 loops. The loop that is supposed\
    \ to find out which meal is \"eaten\" can only run 2 times, and that is for the\
    \ meal that is \"not eaten\". Then you do another loop which is run 2 times (for\
    \ the meal that is \"eaten\" and the meal that is \"not eaten\"). Then you check\
    \ if the number is divisible by 3. If yes, then you add it to the \"eaten\" array.\
    \ If not, you add it to the \"not eaten\" array. Finally, you print both arrays\
    \ at the end.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe question states that you must return an\
    \ array. And that is my solution. My solution does require 2 loops. You can find\
    \ out which meal is eaten with only two loops.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOk, sorry,\
    \ I misunderstood the question. My apologies.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nYou can do it\

    \ |>\n<| a dscore=3 tags=algorithm,php |>\nA dynamic programming approach would\
    \ be as follows.\nSuppose we start with a total of n carrots (n<=1000)\nLet f(n)\
    \ be the maximum number of carrots you need to eat to get n carrots after meals\
    \ up to n carrots. \nThen, the max number of carrots you can eat after n carrots\
    \ is f(n+1).\nLet's suppose that after n carrots, you only have m carrots, which\
    \ is equal to f(n).\nThe max number of carrots you need to eat after m carrots\
    \ is f(n+m). \nSo we can just compute f(n) by applying f(n+1) to f(n+m). \nSo\
    \ the solution would be f(n)=f(n+1)+f(n+m) for m>n. \nThe trick here is how do\
    \ we compute f(n+m) without running f(n+1) again?\nThe answer is f(n+m)=max(f(n+1),f(n+m-1)).\
    \ The only problem is how do we compute f(n+m-1) without running f(n+m).\nSince\
    \ f(n) is the maximum number of carrots you can eat after n carrots, we can just\
    \ check if f(n) is less than f(n+1).\n<code>\n<?php\n\nfunction candidate(...$args)\

    <|/ a dscore=2 tags=php,arrays |>\n<| c |>\nOh, this looks interesting. I'm new\
    \ to PHP, but this looks like a lot of work. I'll test it out and come back if\
    \ I still have questions.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you! This worked for me. I\
    \ modified it a bit to make it work for my program. I also added the array to\
    \ a database table so I can retrieve it later, but that's not really relevant.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nGlad I could help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI think this is what\
    \ you're looking for - \n<code>\n$arr = array(4, 12, 8, 11);\n$arr = [4,12,8,11];\n\
    \n$carrots = array();\n$numOfCarrots = count($arr);\n$numberOfCarrots = count($arr)\
    \ - 1;\n$arrayLength = count($arr) - 1;\n\nfor($i = 0; $i <= $numberOfCarrots;\
    \ $i++) {\n    for($j = 0; $j <= $arrayLength; $j++) {\n        $carrots[] = $arr[$i];\n\
    \    }\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=0 tags=php,arrays |>\n<| c |>\nI forgot to mention\
    \ that I also have to return the array index. So in that example it would be array(1,\
    \ 2, 3, 4). I know that I can use the array_push method, but if I were to return\
    \ $carrots how would I grab the index that was added to the array?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a tags=php,arrays |>\n<code>\n$arr = array(4, 12, 8, 11);\n\n$carrots = array();\n\

    I suppose it depends on the constraint. Since I answered the question asked, the\
    \ constraints were only asked. The OP didn't ask about constraints in general.\
    \ He specifically asked about the constraints set for meals.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The OP specifically asked the constraints to be given in the question. I had to\
    \ read it several times until I realized that the constraints had to be given\
    \ in the question as well. Also, I'm not the OP, so I'm not in the habit of just\
    \ blindly answering questions that I saw on the OP's profile without asking first.\
    \ Thanks for the upvote though.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYeah, I thought the OP was\
    \ asking for that. No worries, though. Just thought it would be a good idea to\
    \ point that out to whoever asked the question first.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo worries.\

    This looks like a job for Dynamic programming\nThe key is to find and store an\
    \ algorithm that is able to calculate the optimal solution (i.e. minimize the\
    \ number of carrots left).\nI didn't solve the problem completely, but if you\
    \ think about it I think it can be solved with a DP approach (no code here, only\
    \ a description of a solution).\nStart with a DP table with all the possible outcomes\
    \ (i.e. how will you eat n carrots if you already have them in stock)\nThe algorithm\
    \ is to find and store an algorithm (that solves the problem) that can calculate\
    \ the number of carrots left in a certain time period. \nFor example, you know\
    \ the number of carrots left in your time period is 5, but the number of carrots\
    \ left if your are hungry is 3, then you can only have 3 carrots left in your\
    \ time period.\nThe solution to this is to store all the possible outcomes (i.e.\
    \ how will you eat n carrots if you already have them in stock), so for example\
    \ the table will look like this:\n<code>\n      carrots left\n ---------------\n\
    \    1 ->  1\n    2 ->  2\n    3 ->  3\n    4 ->  4\n    5 ->  5\n    6 ->  6\n\
    \    7 ->  7\n    8 ->  8\n    9 ->  9\n   10 -> 10\n</code>\nThen, for a given\
    \ time period, you can calculate the result of this algorithm by doing the following:\n\
    <code>\n  table[x][y] holds the number of carrots left when you are hungry and\
    \ you eat x carrots, and have already eaten\n  y carrots\n\n  table[x][x] holds\
    \ the number of carrots left when you are hungry and you eat x carrots, and have\
    \ NOT eaten\n  x carrots\n</code>\nThe table above shows the number of carrots\
    \ left if you have already eaten x carrots, and you are hungry, and the number\
    \ of carrots left if your are hungr\nfunction candidate(...$args) {\n    return\

    <|/ a dscore=1 tags=php,arrays,sum |>\n<| a tags=php,arrays,sum |>\nIt may be\
    \ more intuitive to think of this as a \"binary search problem\". Consider you\
    \ have a list of items and you want to find the first item that is less than or\
    \ equal to the number of carrots you have eaten. If the number of carrots is larger\
    \ than the sum of the items in your list, the smallest item that you could find\
    \ is at the end of the list. Once you have found that item, then you have an indication\
    \ that the next item to eat is one less than the item you just found. Continue\
    \ repeating this process to find the next item that is less than or equal to the\
    \ number of carrots you have eaten, and so on. Eventually you will have an item\
    \ that is less than or equal to the number of carrots you have eaten, which you\
    \ have your solution.\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nThe function you're\
    \ looking for is the array_sum() function. Assuming that you're using PHP 5.5+\
    \ you can write something like this:\n<code>\n<?php\n\n$carrots = 5;\n$totalCarrots\
    \ = 7;\n\n$need = array_sum(range($totalCarrots, $carrots));\n\n$remainingCarrots\
    \ = $carrots - $totalCarrots;\n\n$totalNeed = $need;\n$totalNeed[$totalCarrots]\
    \ = $totalCarrots;\n$totalNeed[$remainingCarrots] = $remainingCarrots;\n\nprint_r($totalNeed);\n\
    </code>\n<|/ a tags=php,arrays,sum |>\n<| a tags=php,arrays,sum dscore=0 |>\n\
    In PHP 7.4, you can use array_sum with range.\n<code>\n$carrots = 5;\n$totalCarrots\
    \ = 7;\n\n$need = array_sum(range($totalCarrots, $carrots));\n\n$remainingCarrots\
    \ = $carrots - $totalCarrots;\n\n$totalNeed = $need;\n$totalNeed[$totalCarrots]\
    \ = $totalCarrots;\n$totalNeed[$remainingCarrots] = $remainingCarrots;\n\nprint_r($totalNeed);\n\
    </code>\nOutput:\n<code>\nArray\n(\n    [0] => 7\n    [1] => 4\n    [2] => 5\n\
    )\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=php,arrays,sum |>\nThis is my solution\
    \ using recursion:\n<code>\n<?php\nfunction candidate(...$args) {\n    return\
    \ eat(...$args);\n}\n\nfunction test(): void {\n    if (candidate(5, 6, 10) !==\
