  program: "# I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\

    # definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n# Your task is to determine if\
    \ a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n# You are given\
    \ two vectors of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a\
    \ match. \n# Return a vector of the same length denoting how far off each guess\
    \ was. If they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the value\
    \ is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\n# >>>\
    \ compare(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1), c(1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2))\n# c(0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3)\n\
