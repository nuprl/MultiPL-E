prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly,\
  \ and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic\
  \ list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight\
  \ w.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) \n    False \n    # 1+2 is\
  \ less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n\n        # it's\
  \ balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n\n        # 3+2+3\
  \ is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n\n        # 3 is\
  \ less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n    \"\"\"\nfunction\
