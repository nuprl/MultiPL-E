prompt: "/// Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n///\
  \ n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n\
  /// are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n\
  /// each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n\
  /// when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n\
  /// However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue\
  \ moving\n/// in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n/// This function\
  \ outputs the number of such collisions.\nfn car_race_collision(n: isize) -> isize\
