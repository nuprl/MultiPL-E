- program: "\"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive\
    \ integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the\
    \ range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\
    \n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n\
    \    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n\
    \    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n\
    \    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells\
    \ (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path\
    \ A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after\
    \ making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through\
    \ (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than\
    \ lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such\
    \ that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] =\
