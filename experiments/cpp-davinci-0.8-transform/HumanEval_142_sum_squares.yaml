prompt: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// \"\n// This function will\
  \ take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square\
  \ the integer entry if its index is a \n// multiple of 3 and will cube the integer\
  \ entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will\
  \ not \n// change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3\
  \ or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \n// Examples:\n\
  // >>> lst\n// (long({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3}))\n// >>> lst\n// (long())\n//\
  \ >>> lst\n// (long({(long)-1, (long)-5, (long)2, (long)-1, (long)-5}))\nlong sum_squares(std::vector<long>\
