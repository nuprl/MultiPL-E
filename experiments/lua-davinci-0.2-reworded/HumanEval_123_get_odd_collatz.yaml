prompt: "-- Given a positive integer n, return a sorted table that has the odd numbers\
  \ in collatz sequence.\n-- The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics\
  \ that concerns a sequence defined\n-- as follows: start with any positive integer\
  \ n. Then each term is obtained from the \n-- previous term as follows: if the previous\
  \ term is even, the next term is one half of \n-- the previous term. If the previous\
  \ term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n-- term plus 1. The conjecture\
  \ is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n-- Note:\
  \ \n-- 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n-- 2. returned table sorted in increasing order.\n\
  -- For example:\n-- get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for\
  \ 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n-- >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n\
