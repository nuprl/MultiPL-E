  program: "# Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer\
    \ k, \n# each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1,\

    \ to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n# from any\
    \ cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n# in other\
    \ words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n# cell.\n#\
    \ Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n# necessarily\
    \ distinct).\n# You CANNOT go off the grid.\n# A path A (of length k) is considered\
