  \ to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n\
  # You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index\
  \ shows a match. \n# Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each\
  \ guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the\
  \ value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\n\
  # compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n# compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])\
