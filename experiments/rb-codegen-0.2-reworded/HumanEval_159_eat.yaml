prompt: "# You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of\
  \ carrots,\n# but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n\
  # you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n\
  # the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n# if there are not enough remaining\
  \ carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n# Example:\n\
  # >>> eat.call(5, 6, 10)\n# [11, 4]\n# >>> eat.call(4, 8, 9)\n# [12, 1]\n# >>> eat.call(1,\
  \ 10, 10)\n# [11, 0]\n# >>> eat.call(2, 11, 5)\n# [7, 0]\n# Variables:\n# @number\
  \ : integer\n# the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n# @need : integer\n#\
  \ the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n# @remaining : integer\n# the number\
  \ of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n# Constrain:\n# * 0 <= number <= 1000\n\
  # * 0 <= need <= 1000\n# * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n# Have fun :)\ndef eat(number,\
