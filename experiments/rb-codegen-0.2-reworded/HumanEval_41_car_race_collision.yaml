prompt: "# Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n# n cars\
  \ are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n# are driving\
  \ right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n# each other.\
  \  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n# when a car\
  \ that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n# However,\
  \ the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n\
  # in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n# This function outputs the number\
