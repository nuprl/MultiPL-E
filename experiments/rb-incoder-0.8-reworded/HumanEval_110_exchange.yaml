    \ this homework?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAlso, what do you mean by \"make lst1 an\

    <| c |>\nThis is actually a homework problem. I just got introduced to Ruby. Thanks\

    \ to the post.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nHere's some Ruby code that may help you understand\
    \ how to implement this problem. First, I wrote a method that takes two arrays\
    \ of integers and returns true if all the even elements of the first array are\
    \ also even, and false if not. Then, I wrote another method that takes two arrays\
    \ of integers and returns true if all the even elements of all the elements in\
    \ both arrays are even, and false if not. The last method I wrote will take two\
    \ arrays of integers, and return true if all the even elements of the first array\
    \ are also even, and false if any of the even elements of one array are odd, and\
    \ false if all of the even elements of the two arrays are odd. Here's the code:\n\

    // Iterate over one array and for each value\n//    1) Check if it is even in\

    \ a recursive or iterative solution to it. I was thinking of using some sort of\
    \ \"while\" statement or similar, but I couldn't figure out how to do that with\
    \ a conditional statement. \nI figured that since you can exchange two elements\
    \ to make them even, that there would be a way to exchange two elements to make\
    \ them odd, if you can exchange one element to make it even, then that would mean\
    \ it can exchange one element to make it odd, which would make them even, which\
    \ would make the even element odd which would make the odd element even. So, I\
    \ am thinking you can do this with a while loop, but I am not sure how to implement\
    \ it in Ruby. \nI am new to Ruby and would really appreciate some help on this.\
    \ \nI really appreciate your help! \nI really do appreciate it greatly!\n<|/ q\

    \ the elements of lst1 are allowed to be odd. However, it sounds like the elements\
    \ of lst2 are allowed to be even. It would really help if you could provide the\
    \ expected output for several different inputs (i.e. what should happen when lst1=[1,2,3,4,5]\

    \ a mathematical problem than a programming problem to me. There are no constraints\
    \ on input arrays, and the goal is to swap even and odd elements together, so\

    </code>\nYou can use the sort_by function instead, which doesn't modify the array\
