    \ Questions\nIn this exercise, you will develop a function that performs the calculations\
    \ given two bank account instances. One operation is an amount and the other is\
    \ a deposit or withdrawal from the account. You will use this function to implement\
    \ the withdrawal function of the bank account. Recall that the withdrawal function\
    \ will deposit money from the account and return a tuple containing the new balance\
    \ and the new account balance as returned by deposit. You will call this function\
    \ from within the withdrawal function and make sure it works as expected. The\
    \ function should work by calling the deposit function and depositing the amount\
    \ and then calling the withdrawal function with the amount returned by the deposit\

    \ is fine but `any?` is more efficient in both time and space (as there is no\

    \ is more efficient than `all?` so `all?` is preferable.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\

    \ this worked. But I was looking for an explanation as to why it didn't work without\
    \ using `each`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe `each` method returns an enumerator of\
    \ the given array or collection. Your code `if operations[i] < 0 then` will always\
    \ fail, since `i` will be always less than `#length`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOhhh\
    \ I get it now. I thought `each` returned an array. Thanks a lot.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n`each` returns an enumerator, but `each` doesn't return an array. It\
    \ returns an enumerator that is an iterator over the array, which allows you to\
    \ access an element in one line and do something with that element. But if you\
    \ use `each` on a collection (like `[1,2,3].each`), then it will return an enumerator\
    \ that yields the elements in the array. The collection itself isn't an array.\n\

    >14. Beautiful Recurse</h3>\n<p>Recursive solutions can be unreadable and hard\
    \ to read. As such, they often encourage code reuse. One of the reasons why\n\
    recursive code is easier to read is that it can be easily written to solve a problem\
    \ using only a small amount of code. Let\u2019s look at how this can be done in\
    \ Ruby</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">class Recurse\n  def factorial(n,\
    \ acc = 1)\n    if n &lt;= 0\n      acc\n    else\n      factorial(n-1, n * acc)\n\
    \    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code solves the factorial function\
    \ by passing in an initial value of 1, then calling itself in each step by decrementing\
    \ n by one, and passing the new value of acc in each recursive step. In Ruby there\
    \ is a shorthand for writing recursive methods, you can pass in the initial value\
    \ and return the result of the recursive call.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\"\
    >class Recurse\n  def factorial(n)\n    n.zero? ? 1 : n * factorial(n-1)\n  end\n\
    end\n</code></pre>\n<p>Recursive code is a little tricky, but it makes sense once\
    \ you wrap your head around it. This code solves the factorial function by passing\
    \ in an initial value of 1, then calling itself in each step by decrementing n\
    \ by one, and passing the new value of acc in each recursive step.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ next step is understanding how this code does something useful. The factorial\
    \ function accepts an argument of n and uses that to calculate its factorial.\
    \ In the case of the factorial function if n is zero the result should be 1, otherwise\
    \ the result should be n * the factorial of n-1, which means that our function\
    \ will call itself with a decremented value of n and pass it the current value\
    \ of acc.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s break it down line-by-line. The first two lines of\
    \ the function are a little complicated. First, it calls itself recursively, passing\
    \ in n and acc. Second, it uses n to determine whether its factorial is zero or\
    \ not, and if it is, it returns acc. Third, it calls itself recursively, passing\
    \ in n - 1 and acc * n. Note the pattern here. It calls the function recursively\
    \ with n - 1, and then the result of that call is multiplied by the previous value\
    \ of acc. It\u2019s important to note that in the factorial function it uses n-1\
    \ to calculate factorial, and it passes that value to itself recursively.</p>\n\
