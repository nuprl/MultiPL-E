    \ do and how does it relate to cars[c1].location.x? Third, I'm pretty sure you\

    <| c |>\nSorry to hear that my code didn't work.  I forgot about the distinction\
    \ between logical and arithmetic operators in Ruby; `c1 < n` is true when `c1`\
    \ is less than `n`.  Similarly, `c2 < n` is true when `c2` is less than `n`. \
    \ So the loop condition would have to be `while c1 < n || c2 < n` to check for\
    \ a collision between two cars.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay I think I understand\
    \ what's happening but I'm having a hard time converting it to Ruby. How does\
    \ c1.location.x relate to cars[c1].location.x? What's the significance of cars[c1]?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited the code to make it more Rubythonic and to remove\

    \ get car_race_collision to return the right information by doing: `puts car_race_collision(3)`,\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I see how you could come up with the \"simplest\" solution;\
    \ I'm just not all that familiar with mathematical concepts well enough to implement\
    \ it that way. Your answer definitely helps, though. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    By the way, thanks for that great answer! I do have one question: why is the `if`\
    \ clause necessary in the last line of `car_race_collision`?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    One would need to exclude the `if` clause if the car was already colliding with\
    \ another car.  Since it's possible that a collision can happen with a car already\
    \ colliding with another car, I believe that `if` is necessary to account for\
    \ this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI hope that I've understood your question right. Suppose\
    \ you have a pair of cars A and B which are moving on a straight line and car\
    \ A is on the left and carB is on the right.\nWhat you need is to figure out whether\
    \ two cars collide or not. \nThis can be done by finding the distance of the cars\
    \ from each other and then adding them and then comparing that to the total distance\
    \ between the cars. If the total distance is less than the distance between the\
    \ cars, they do not collide.\n<|/ a dscore=0 tags=algorithm,language-agnostic,computational-geometry\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThat would work if the cars were moving in the same direction.\
    \  However, they would have to collide if they're moving in opposite directions\
    \ (i.e. one car moving forward, while the other one moving backward), which means\
    \ this wouldn't work. That's why my proposed solution, which is based on the fact\
    \ that they can only move in one direction, relies on checking the distance from\
    \ one end of the car to the other.  But that may prove problematic when there\
    \ are more than 2 cars to check, e.g. when there are 3 cars to check.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a |>\nA simple approach would be to simply check each pair of cars with the\
