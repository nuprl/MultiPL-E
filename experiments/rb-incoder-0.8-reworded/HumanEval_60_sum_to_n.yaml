    \  <p>\n    Memoization is when you store the result of a function call so you\
    \ don't need to recompute it later. Memoization is like caching your results.\
    \ You\u2019ve already implemented the caching version of <code>sum_to_n</code>\
    \ in the <code>memoize</code> method in the first exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n \
    \   What does memoization mean anyway? It means that you can avoid repeatedly\
    \ calculating the same result of a function so you can\u2019t repeat it multiple\
    \ times. If you call <code>sum_to_n</code> the second time with the same argument\
    \ it will return the result from the cache instead of recalculating it.\n  </p>\n\
    \  <p>\n    Why is this important? It means that you\u2019ve implemented an algorithm\
    \ to solve a problem that is commonly called <code>fizzbuzz</code>. This algorithm\
    \ can take a very long time to run. It\u2019s likely that someone else will use\
    \ the algorithm and the same value will be calculated over and over again. So,\
    \ if you don\u2019t memoize this algorithm, the same problem will run for ever\
    \ until your computer runs out of memory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In case you\u2019\
    re wondering why this is important, consider if you had just called <code>sum_to_n</code>\
    \ twice in the above code example. You\u2019d have to wait 5 seconds to get your\
    \ program to output the result again. How could you possibly wait 5 seconds if\
    \ you couldn\u2019t possibly remember what the result was?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  \
    \  Memoization can be very useful in many situations. One of the most important\
    \ ones is when you\u2019re calculating values based on other values \u2013 like\
    \ sums.\n  </p>\n  <h4>3. What is recursion?</h4>\n  <p>\n    Recursion is when\
    \ you call a function inside of a function. In other words, you write a function\
    \ that calls itself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    For example, consider the problem of\
    \ computing factorials. You can either write a function that calls itself over\
    \ and over again, or you can write a function that uses a loop to compute the\
    \ factorial.\n  </p>\n  <pre><code>def factorial(n)\n  if n == 0\n    1\n  else\n\
