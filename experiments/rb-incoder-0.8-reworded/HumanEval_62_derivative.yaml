    \  `call` should *not* call `@xs.call(x)`.  The reason for this is that `@xs.call(x)`\

    \ a polynomial using Newton's method. For example, if we're trying to minimize\
    \ function of polynomial:\n<code>\nf(x) = x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x + 3*x[2]*x^2 +\
    \ 4*x[3]*x^3 + 5*x[4]*x^4 + 6*x[5]*x^5 + 7*x[6]*x^6\n</code>\nNewton's method\
    \ is basically gradient descent algorithm, but we need to start with a simple\
    \ guess, instead of an arbitrary value. The gradient of the function f at any\
    \ point is given by:\n<code>\nf'(x) = 2*x[0] + 6*x[1] + 12*x[2] + 24*x[3] + 36*x[4]\
    \ + 48*x[5] + 64*x[6]\n</code>\nTherefore, the gradients of f and f' at any point\
    \ x are:\n<code>\nf'(x) = (2x[0] + 6*x[1] + 12*x[2] + 24*x[3] + 36*x[4] + 48*x[5]\
    \ + 64*x[6]) / 6\nf''(x) = (6*x[0] + 12*x[1] + 24*x[2] + 36*x[3] + 48*x[4] + 64*x[5]\
    \ + 72*x[6]) / 6\n</code>\nAnd Newton's method uses the direction of the gradient:\n\
    <code>\nf'(x) / f''(x) = (1/6)*(2x[0] + 6*x[1] + 12*x[2] + 24*x[3] + 36*x[4] +\
    \ 48*x[5] + 64*x[6]) + (2/6)*(6*x[0] + 12*x[1] + 24*x[2] + 36*x[3] + 48*x[4] +\
    \ 64*x[5] + 72*x[6])\n</code>\nTherefore, Newton's method is to find the point\
    \ x that minimizes the function:\n<code>\nf'(x) / f''(x) = (1/6)*(2*x[0] + 6*x[1]\
    \ + 12*x[2] + 24*x[3] + 36*x[4] + 48*x[5] + 64*x[6]) + (2/6)*(6*x[0] + 12*x[1]\
    \ + 24*x[2] + 36*x[3] + 48*x[4] + 64*x[5] + 72*x[6])\nf'(x) / f''(x) = 2/6\nx\
    \ = 1/6\n</code>\nHere's the code. It's simple since I'm only implementing the\
    \ gradient for the function f, and not the gradient of the derivative function,\
