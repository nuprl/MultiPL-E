    \ the second question, I'd suggest you use factorial or math to do this, or even\
    \ better, use the Bignum library for Ruby to do it for you. Look at these questions\
    \ for some info on how it works: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1418148/how-can-i-multiply-two-very-long-numbers-in-ruby\
    \ or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407898/multiplying-very-long-integers-in-ruby\n\
    <|/ a dscore=1 tags=bignum,ruby |>\n<| a tags=bignum,ruby dscore=1 |>\nA lot of\
    \ people are suggesting that the use of Bignum here is a bad idea, because it's\
    \ too slow for anything other than a few numbers. The problem is that when you\
    \ call to_i on the big number, Ruby needs to create a String, and that can take\
    \ time. \nHowever, even if you use a Bignum library, you'll still be limited to\
    \ numbers that fit in a single machine's memory.\nSo I'd recommend that you use\
    \ some sort of \"big integer\" library to do the work for you, such as the GMP\
    \ library. It supports arbitrarily large integers, and it has a ruby binding.\
    \ One of my favorites is the GMP Ruby library.\nGMP can be really confusing at\
    \ first, but once you get used to it, it's a lot more robust than Bignum. It has\
    \ lots of features that make it perfect for working with large numbers. \nI should\
    \ also mention that GMP supports most popular languages. So you could easily use\
    \ it from Ruby.\n<|/ a |>\n<| a tags=bignum,ruby dscore=1 |>\nThe question asks\
    \ for arbitrary precision, which means you need arbitrary precision for the numbers\
    \ you will be multiplying and summing.  As others have noted, Bignum is not going\
    \ to help you in that case, because Bignums are only good for integers, not arbitrary\
    \ precision integers.  I wrote a gem called bigdecimal that will do arbitrary\
    \ precision.  \nThe gem is not yet a stable release, however it will eventually\
    \ be released and maintained.  You can find it here :\nhttps://github.com/andrewvueringa/bigdecimal\n\
