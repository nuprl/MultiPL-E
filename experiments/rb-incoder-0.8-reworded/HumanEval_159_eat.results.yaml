    </code>\n<|/ a tags=ruby,arrays,sorting |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for this answer!\
    \ It helped me a lot. I used your example to create a method that also returns\

    \ [11, 4])\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nYour problem statement is wrong. You say you should\
    \ return an array with the first element being the number of meals remaining and\
    \ the second element being the number of carrots remaining. For example:\n<code>\n\
    eat.call(5, 6, 10)\n</code>\nshould return [11, 4].\nTo do that, you need to use\
    \ a while loop that stops when the number of remaining carrots reaches zero. Something\
    \ like this:\n<code>\nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval < Test::Unit::TestCase\n\
    \  def test_eat\n    candidate = method(:eat)\n    assert_equal([11, 4], candidate.call(5,\

    <|/ a tags=ruby dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nI'm still new at Ruby so i might not be\
    \ understanding your code.  I'm more or less trying to understand it so i can\
    \ apply it next time.  How could I go about doing this?  Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nSorry for the delay! :) I was actually working on the code before I saw\
    \ the response. The important part is that you have a method which takes 3 parameters,\
    \ number need, and remaining carrots. Within the method, you put puts \"#{number}\
    \ #{need} #{remaining}\". Then, you need to call this method with your parameters\
    \ and get the output back. Hope that helps :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks! This\
    \ helps a lot.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=ruby |>\nI used a hash to keep track\
    \ of your meals, with the meal name as the key\n<code>\nh = Hash.new(0)\n</code>\n\
    and here is the main part where I increment the value of the hash if the key already\
    \ exists\n<code>\nh[\"Cola\"] = h[\"Cola\"] + 1\nh[\"Fanta\"] = h[\"Fanta\"] +\
    \ 1\nh[\"Sprite\"] = h[\"Sprite\"] + 1\nh[\"Burger\"] = h[\"Burger\"] + 1\nh[\"\
    Salad\"] = h[\"Salad\"] + 1\n</code>\nIf you want the results stored in a list,\
    \ you can do this\n<code>\narr = [h[\"Cola\"], h[\"Fanta\"], h[\"Sprite\"], h[\"\
    Burger\"], h[\"Salad\"]]\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for this but I'm\
    \ still confused.  I'm pretty new to programming and i just started learning Ruby\
    \ last week.  Would you mind explaining the code a little more?\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nI'm getting this error when I run the code: ArgumentError: unknown keywords:\
    \ 0, Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Burger, Salad, 5\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOops, forgot `Hash.new(0)`\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`h = Hash.new(0)` was the missing piece\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Oh man, i feel so stupid.  Thank you!  Could I ask what the \"Hash.new(0)\" is\

    <| c |>\nThank you for you answer. Unfortunately I'm still a beginner at Ruby\
    \ so I don't understand your answer.  Your code says \"if meal.carrots >= carrots_left\"\
    . Is that the variable \"carrots_left\" that I'm looking for? Or is it something\
    \ else? Also, what does \"carrots_left -= meal.carrots\" do? I understand \"carrots_left\"\
    , but what does \"meal.carrots\" do? What does it do? I'm still pretty confused\
    \ on how this whole thing works. I'm reading your answer but I still don't really\
    \ understand it.  I appreciate your help.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`carrots_left` is\
    \ the variable you are looking for.  `meal.carrots` gets the number of carrots\
    \ left for that meal.  You subtract the number of carrots left to get how many\
    \ carrots you need to eat.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSo by doing that you're saying\
    \ \"if meal.carrots >= carrots_left\" then  \"carrots_left -= meal.carrots\"?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes.  So if you have 10 carrots in stock, and you're trying\

    \ too, but the while loop is there to make sure that the remaining carrots are\
    \ pushed into the array only once. As I mentioned in my answer, if the amount\
    \ of carrots are more than the remaining carrots, only the first carrots would\
    \ be pushed into the array and hence the array's length will be 1\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 |>\nI would use a Stack data structure (Python or Java or other\
    \ language doesn't matter). It's very simple and you can push carrots on it, and\
    \ pop them off it when you're done with it. It would be something like this:\n\

    \ continue our last practice: the shopping cart problem. Let's add a function\
    \ called shopping which accepts an array of integers as its first parameter. The\
    \ function should return an array of integers as its second parameter. The function\
    \ should return an array of the minimum number of carrots needed to finish the\
    \ cart. These carrots should be distributed evenly throughout the cart. Thus,\
    \ if the cart starts with 3 carrots, then after eating a carrot, there might be\
    \ 5 left in stock. The minimum number of carrots you can make is then 5. Hence\
    \ the function shop(numbers) should return the minimum number of carrots necessary\
    \ to finish the cart. For example:\nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval <\
    \ Test::Unit::TestCase\n  def test_eat\n    candidate = method(:eat)\n    assert_equal([11,\
    \ 4], candidate.call(5, 6, 10))\n    assert_equal([12, 1], candidate.call(4, 8,\

    \ fixed now!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI don't like to use an Array when I want to add\
    \ a single value to a list, so I changed it to an array.  I'll leave the rest\
    \ for you to try and work out, since it's pretty basic code.  Good luck!\n<|/\

    \ && nums[total]<nums[left]) { \n    total += 1;\n    left += 1;\n  }\n  return\
    \ [total - left, left];\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=arrays,algorithm,dynamic-programming\

    \ explain your code a little more? What does `nums.push(0);` do?\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nSorry to bother you, but could you please explain your code a little more?\
    \ What does `nums.push(0);` do? What are `total` and `left` doing in this situation?\
    \ What is this `while(nums.length && nums[total]<nums[left])` doing?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n`nums.push(0)` adds the number `0` at the end of the array. `nums[total]<nums[left]`\
    \ checks to see if the carrots left on the stack are less than the ones left.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSo that means `nums.length` returns how many elements are in\
    \ the array `nums`. Then how does that loop work? `nums[total]<nums[left]` is\
