    \ a dscore=3 tags=ruby,regex |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for your reply, but I think\
    \ your solution doesn't work well for words starting with digits, it returns \"\
    34\" instead of \"345 67\". I've edited my post and added the constraint of digit\
    \ words in the beginning of the sentence.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=ruby,regex |>\n\
    Your problem is probably that the regex you gave is matching \"12345\" instead\
    \ of \"1234567\".\nYou could use a negative lookahead to make sure you do not\
    \ match \"1234567\" and then a negative lookbehind to make sure you do not match\
    \ \"12345\":\n<code>\n/(^|[^0-9])12345(?!$|[^0-9])/i\n</code>\nNote that you would\
    \ need some special handling for \"1234567\" because this would also match \"\
    12345670\".\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nI used a variation of your solution.\
    \ `(^|[^0-9])12345(?!$|[^0-9])` It didn't work well for words starting with digits\
    \ and also for words ending with a digit.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I agree that\
    \ my solution is more general, which was why I added it as a comment.  But I did\
    \ not test it with your additional constraint.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe regex I\
    \ gave will match \"1234567\" but not \"12345\" because a negative lookahead of\
    \ \"1234567\" will match the pattern and make the match fail and a negative lookbehind\
    \ of \"12345\" will make the match fail and thus you do not get \"345\" but \"\
    345\".\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nRight, but this fails for \"345 67\", so it should\
    \ return \"345\".\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\"345 67\" has two spaces between the 3\
    \ and 4.  How would you handle that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\n<code>\ns = \"This is\

    \ (which is apparently about factors), this answer is much more comprehensive\
    \ and informative than any other answer given in this thread that I have seen.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis is not a solution to the question asked. This is an explanation\
    \ of how to solve a specific problem. This solution is very inefficient, though\
    \ - it splits up the sentence into words and then loops over all words to check\
    \ if they are a prime number. He wants a more efficient approach. He should be\
    \ able to do this by himself.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWhile I agree with that sentiment,\
    \ I am afraid to comment on why a solution is inefficient. Certainly my method\
    \ is *not* inefficient since it uses only a fraction of the time it would take\
    \ to solve the problem as presented, and that's very small compared to many other\
    \ methods. It's also not slower than any proposed solution in most programming\
    \ languages. I would be concerned about any approach that takes significant time\
    \ to solve that takes significant time to find the answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    , agreed. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something here.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n, you're absolutely right that it's not a solution to the question asked.\
    \ I was just commenting on the fact that you're solution does not solve the question\
    \ asked. Also, since I wrote this answer before I noticed the question changed,\
    \ I thought it worth mentioning that you had made a mistake in the second solution.\
    \ The second solution should be `words_in_sentence([word])`. I also noticed that\
    \ your solution was using an assignment statement (`=`) instead of a comparison\
    \ operator (`==`).\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=3 tags=ruby,primes |>\n<code>\nrequire\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nNice solution (+1). The only problem with this solution is that\
    \ `is_prime` would have to be called 100*100 times which would make it unusable.\
    \ Also, it would be better to cache the primes instead of checking each number\
    \ on its own like that.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, that is what I am looking for.\
    \ But, since you wrote the algorithm, can you please explain me what the algorithm\
    \ is? I mean what does it do and how it is used? And also, can you please provide\
    \ me the Ruby code for the same?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added some comments to\
    \ explain things. I used the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. There are other\

    \ \"prime\" is generally a synonym of \"primes\". Secondly, in the second code\
    \ example, I think it should be `primes.index(x)` instead of `primes.index[primes.index(x)]`.\
    \ Third, this doesn't actually answer the question asked. I'm afraid it's not\
    \ very helpful in an actual competition setting, though it may have been helpful\
    \ in an interview situation.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh, I totally agree, `primes`\
    \ and `prime` are similar words, but in this case I prefer to refer to them as\
    \ one. `primes` is the array with the prime numbers and it could be used to find\
    \ out if a number is prime or not (by comparing it with another number). I'll\
    \ correct my answer accordingly.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAlso, for those interested\
    \ in how I came up with the algorithm: I first thought to create a hash table\
    \ of prime numbers (i.e. `primes`, `hash = {primes.first => 1, primes.rest =>\
    \ 1}`). Then, I just iterate over the array `words` from `0` to `words.length`,\
    \ checking `hash[words[i]]` when `i == words.length`, which will tell me if the\
    \ number is prime or not.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI agree with that you should use\
    \ primes instead of prime or any such word. However, if you still want this problem\
    \ to be solved using 'primes', here it is.\nFirst we need to find out all the\
    \ prime numbers in the input string 'test'. So, for that, we will use prime numbers\
    \ calculator at http://www.codewars.com/kata/prime-number-calculator.\nWe will\
    \ first take out each word in the input string and then divide each number in\
    \ the word using prime numbers calculator. \nFor example, if our input string\
    \ is 'test', we will divide 'test' by 2 and 2 and get 2.2 which is our prime number.\
    \ Now we will find out if the input string contains any word which is a multiple\
    \ of 2 in the prime numbers calculator.\n<code>\nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval\

    \ in my question but I had the problem of it printing \"is a\" instead of \"is\"\
    .\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe reason why it prints \"is a\" is because you are not\
    \ checking if all words have the same length. When you loop through all characters,\
    \ you are checking if that character is a prime, and if it is, then you add the\
    \ character to your result. After checking all characters, you check if all characters\
    \ were prime, and if it was not,  you return the result. The result variable would\
    \ contain the first character and nothing else (since you did not check and returned\
    \ it). Instead, you should loop through all characters, and for each character,\
    \ check if that character is a prime, and if yes, then you add the character to\
    \ your result.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe only thing that you need to change is `result\
    \ = sentence[0]` instead of `result = sentence[i]`. Also, you can replace `while\
    \ i < len(sentence)` with `while i < sentence.length`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank\

    I thought your question was interesting, so I wrote a solution to it. :)\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for answering my question! I really appreciate it!\
    \ It doesn't exactly solve my problem since my solution relies on the fact that\
    \ `prime_number_hash` is sorted by descending length. But the idea is good, maybe\
    \ I can use it in other situations so I'll accept your answer. I will test it\
    \ against my solution and I'll get back to you :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, Your solution\
    \ is good! I added a little optimization to `prime_number_hash`. My solution is\
    \ still fast enough for my purpose. I wonder if there is any better solution though.\n\
