prompt: "/// You are given two intervals,\n/// where each interval is a pair of integers.\
  \ For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n/// The given intervals are closed\
  \ which means that the interval (start, end)\n/// includes both start and end.\n\
  /// For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.\n\
  /// Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two \n\
  /// intervals is a prime number.\n/// Example, the intersection of the intervals\
  \ (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n/// which its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n\
  /// If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n/// otherwise,\
