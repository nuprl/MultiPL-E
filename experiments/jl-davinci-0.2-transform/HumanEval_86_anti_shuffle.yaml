prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version\
  \ of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated\
  \ by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n\
  \    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order\
  \ of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> anti_shuffle(\"\
  Hi\")\n    \"Hi\"\n    >>> anti_shuffle(\"hello\")\n    \"ehllo\"\n    >>> anti_shuffle(\"\
  Hello World!!!\")\n    \"Hello !!!Wdlor\"\n    \"\"\"\nfunction anti_shuffle(s::String)::String\
