prompt: "\"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents\
  \ a single well,\n    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.\n \
  \   Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from\
  \ it, \n    and all buckets have the same capacity.\n    Your task is to use the\
  \ buckets to empty the wells.\n    Output the number of times you need to lower\
  \ the buckets.\n\n    Example 1:\n    >>> max_fill([[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0],\

  \ 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]], 2)\n    5\n    \n    Example 3:\n    >>>\
  \ max_fill([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], 5)\n    0\n\n    Constraints:\n        * all\
