prompt: "//You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of\

  // the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n// if there are not enough remaining\
  \ carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n// Example:\n\
  // >>> eat(5, 6, 10)\n// [11, 4]\n// >>> eat(4, 8, 9)\n// [12, 1]\n// >>> eat(1,\
  \ 10, 10)\n// [11, 0]\n// >>> eat(2, 11, 5)\n// [7, 0]\n// Variables:\n// @number\
  \ : integer\n// the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n// @need : integer\n\
  // the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n// @remaining : integer\n// the\
