prompt: "/// Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians\
  \ in \n/// the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci\
  \ sequence.\n/// Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\n/// tri(1) =\
  \ 3\n/// tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n/// tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2)\
  \ + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\n/// For example:\n/// tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n///\
  \ tri(4) = 3\n/// tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n/// = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n/// You\
  \ are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the\
  \ \n/// first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n/// Examples:\n/// >>>\
  \ tri(3)\n/// vec![1, 3, 2, 8]\nfn tri(n: isize) -> Vec<isize> {\n"
