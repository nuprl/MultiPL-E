prompt: "/// Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer\
  \ k, \n/// each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1,\
  \ N * N]\n/// inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n/// You\
  \ have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n/// from\
  \ any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n/// in\
  \ other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n/// cell.\n\
  /// Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n///\
  \ necessarily distinct).\n/// You CANNOT go off the grid.\n/// A path A (of length\
  \ k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n/// after making the ordered\
  \ lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n/// through (let's call them\
  \ lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n/// than lst_B, in other words,\
  \ there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n/// such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i]\
  \ and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n/// lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n/// It is guaranteed\
  \ that the answer is unique.\n/// Return an ordered list of the values on the cells\
  \ that the minimum path go through.\n/// Examples:    \n/// >>> minPath(vec![vec![1,\
  \ 2, 3], vec![4, 5, 6], vec![7, 8, 9]], 3)\n/// vec![1, 2, 1]\n/// >>> minPath(vec![vec![5,\
  \ 9, 3], vec![4, 1, 6], vec![7, 8, 2]], 1)\n/// vec![1]\nfn minPath(grid: Vec<Vec<isize>>,\
  \ k: isize) -> Vec<isize> {\n"
