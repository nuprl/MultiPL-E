prompt: "/// Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False\
  \ otherwise.\n/// The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list)\
  \ and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight\
  \ w.\n/// Example:\n/// >>> will_it_fly(vec![1, 2], 5)\n/// false\n/// # 1+2 is\
  \ less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n/// >>> will_it_fly(vec![3,\

  \ possible weight.\n/// >>> will_it_fly(vec![3, 2, 3], 9)\n/// true\n/// # 3+2+3\
  \ is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n/// >>> will_it_fly(vec![3],\
