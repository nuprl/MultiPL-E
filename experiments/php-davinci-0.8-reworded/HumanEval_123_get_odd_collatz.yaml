prompt: "<?php\n// Given a positive integer n, return a sorted array that has the\
  \ odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n// The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in\
  \ mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n// as follows: start with any positive\
  \ integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n// previous term as follows:\
  \ if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n// the previous term.\
  \ If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n// term plus\
  \ 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always\
  \ reach 1.\n// Note: \n// 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n// 2. returned array sorted in\
  \ increasing order.\n// For example:\n// get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The\
  \ collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1,\
  \ and 5.\n// >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n// array(1, 5)\nfunction get_odd_collatz($n)\
