    \ list of cars moving right to left has the property that\n\t// the start times\

    // 1. Pick the middle element of the moving left to right car list.\n\t// 2. Pick\
    \ the middle element of the moving right to left car list.\n\t// 3. Compare the\
    \ absolute difference between the start times of these\n\t//    two cars.  Because\
    \ the lists are sorted, there can be only 3 cases:\n\t//    Case 1: The absolute\

    \ at the same time as the moving right to left\n\t//            car.  This can\
    \ be interpreted as a collision.  If this is the\n\t//            case, we will\
    \ increment the collision counter by 1.\n\t//    Case 2: The absolute difference\
