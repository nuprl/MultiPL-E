    Exercise 3\nUsing the function eat(), write a recursive function that returns\
    \ the minimum number of carrots to get from your initial stock of carrots and\
    \ a given meal plan.\nThe function should return the minimum number of carrots\
    \ needed to get to the meal plan and return the remaining number of carrots left\
    \ in the stock of carrots after your meals.\nExamples:\neat({10, 10, 10, 10, 10},\
    \ 4) -> 9\neat({10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 10) -> 4\neat({10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 2) ->\
    \ 8\neat({ 10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 4) -> 9\neat({ 10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 10) -> 4\n\
    eat({ 10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 2) -> 8\neat({ 10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 7) -> 11\neat({\
    \ 10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 8) -> 9\neat({ 10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, 10) -> 9\nHints:\n\
    You may use min(), max(), and if statements to solve this problem.\nThe function\
    \ eat() should call itself recursively, passing the needed number of carrots as\
    \ a parameter, until the number of carrots needed, is zero or negative.\nThe function\
    \ eat should return a tuple with two elements, the first one is the number of\
    \ carrots left in the stock of carrots after your meals and the second one is\
    \ the number of carrots needed to get to the meal plan.\nIn addition, the function\
    \ should have a base case, where it can return either nil or an empty list.\n\

    \ it but I'm stuck on how I would use this to solve the problem above. Could you\
    \ give me an example to see how this would work?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: This does\
    \ not require any further effort! You should be able to take what you learned\
    \ in this class and apply it in a couple places.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay, so\
    \ I understand your method but I'm really struggling to put this into a code where\
    \ it would solve this problem. Would I add this code to the function I already\
    \ have or what?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: You are going to need to write some code\
    \ and test it to see if it works. There is some good information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4793525/how-to-make-a-function-more-readable-with-parameters-in-it).\
    \ A good place to start would be to create a function called `eat` that takes\
    \ 3 parameters (as shown above). To test it out, create 3 separate instances of\
    \ `eat` that have 3 different numbers (`number`, `need`, and `remaining`). The\
    \ `eat` function I have written does not allow you to take in any information\
    \ other than those 3 parameters. You would call the `eat` function from within\
    \ another function using `eat()`. I suggest you take the time to work through\
    \ this tutorial to help you get started. [Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/\n\
