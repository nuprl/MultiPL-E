prompt: "-- Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n-- n\
  \ cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n--\
  \ are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n\
  -- each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n\
  -- when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n\
  -- However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue\
  \ moving\n-- in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n-- This function outputs\
  \ the number of such collisions.\nlocal function car_race_collision(n)\n"
