    \ to need to write some code and test it to see if it works. There is some good\
    \ information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4793525/how-to-make-a-function-more-readable-with-parameters-in-it).\
    \ A good place to start would be to create a function called `eat` that takes\
    \ 3 parameters (as shown above). To test it out, create 3 separate instances of\
    \ `eat` that have 3 different numbers (`number`, `need`, and `remaining`). The\
    \ `eat` function I have written does not allow you to take in any information\
    \ other than those 3 parameters. You would call the `eat` function from within\
    \ another function using `eat()`. I suggest you take the time to work through\
    \ this tutorial to help you get started. [Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/",
