    I appreciate your answer, thank you! But your implementation is not optimal. You\
    \ have to loop over all cars to find collisions because you only have to compare\
    \ the first two cars of your sequence. But that would mean to compare all cars\
    \ until you found a collision. This would be more expensive than comparing only\
    \ the 2 first cars.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=language-agnostic,algorithm,race |>\n\
    I implemented this in JavaScript and Python.  It took me a while to figure out\
    \ how to implement it.  I first tried the brute-force approach of comparing all\
    \ the combinations of pairs of cars.  It seemed too slow and to me it seemed too\
    \ complex.  A few hours with Google search turned up an article that described\
    \ a much more sophisticated way of implementing it.  It is a variation on race\
    \ tracking, which I will describe shortly.\nAlgorithm:\nlu = require('luaunit')\n\

    \  -- The original implementation can be found at:\n  -- http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23659-robin-wilson-car-detection\n\
    \  -- A description of the algorithm is given in the paper's comments.\n  -- The\
    \ function returns 0 if there are no collisions, 1 if there is a collision\n \
    \ -- between any two cars, and 2 if there is at least one collision between any\
    \ two cars\n  -- and one between cars moving at the same speed.\n  -- n must be\
    \ positive.\n  -- This function is written in Matlab, so some minor syntax differences\
    \ are\n  -- necessary (like using uint8 to index into an array instead of double).\n\
    \  -- The function was tested against the following road network:\n  --\n  --\

    \ contains two intersections, and the cars are\n  -- moving at different speeds.)\n\
