prompt: "# It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades\n\
  # to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.\n# The\
  \ only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.\n# She has given\
  \ you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write \n# a function that\
  \ can output a list of letter grades using the following table:\n# GPA       | \
  \   Letter grade\n# 4.0                A+\n# > 3.7                A \n# > 3.3  \
  \              A- \n# > 3.0                B+\n# > 2.7                B \n# > 2.3\
  \                B-\n# > 2.0                C+\n# > 1.7                C\n# > 1.3\
  \                C-\n# > 1.0                D+ \n# > 0.7                D \n# >\
  \ 0.0                D-\n# 0.0                E\n# Example:\ndef numerical_letter_grade(grades)\n"
