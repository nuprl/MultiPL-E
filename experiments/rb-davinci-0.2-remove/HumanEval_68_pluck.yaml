prompt: "# \"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative\
  \ integer nodes\n# your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n# The\
  \ plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n# If multiple nodes\
  \ with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest\
  \ index.\n# The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its\
  \ index ],\n# If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\
  # Example 1:\n# Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest\
  \ index.\n# Example 2:\n# Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has\
  \ the smallest index.\n# Example 3:\n# Example 4:\n# Explanation: 0 is the smallest\
  \ value, but  there are two zeros,\n# so we will choose the first zero, which has\
  \ the smallest index.\n# Constraints:\n# * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n# * 0 <=\
  \ node.value\ndef pluck(arr)\n"
