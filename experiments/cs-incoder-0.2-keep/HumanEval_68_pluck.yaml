  \ Problem {\n    // \"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative\
  \ integer nodes\n    // your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n\
  \    // The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n    //\
  \ If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node\
  \ that has smallest index.\n    // The plucked node should be returned in a list,\
  \ [ smalest_value, its index ],\n    // If there are no even values or the given\
  \ array is empty, return [].\n    // Example 1:\n    // Input: [4,2,3]\n    // Output:\
  \ [2, 1]\n    // Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest\
  \ index.\n    // Example 2:\n    // Input: [1,2,3]\n    // Output: [2, 1]\n    //\
  \ Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. \n \
  \   // Example 3:\n    // Input: []\n    // Output: []\n    // Example 4:\n    //\
  \ Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\n    // Output: [0, 1]\n    // Explanation: 0 is the\
  \ smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n    // so we will choose the first\
  \ zero, which has the smallest index.\n    // Constraints:\n    // * 1 <= nodes.length\
  \ <= 10000\n    // * 0 <= node.value\n    public static List<long> Pluck(List<long>\
