    Thanks for your answer. Could you please explain the code a little bit more? I\
    \ understand that you are trying to find the number of ways to fill the grid with\
    \ the capacity of 1 but I don't understand how you got that result.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThe idea is to fill the grid with the capacity of 1 by filling each row\
    \ and column with 1 unit of water. Then, for each row and column with 1 unit of\
    \ water, you can either empty the row or column by filling each cell with capacity\
    \ - 1, and you can either empty the row or column by filling each cell with capacity\
    \ - 1, and so on. So, if you have capacity of 1, you can fill the grid with the\
    \ capacity of 1 by filling each row and column with 1 unit of water, and you can\
    \ either empty the row or column by filling each cell with capacity - 1, and you\
    \ can either empty the row or column by filling each cell with capacity - 1, and\
    \ so on. So, the number of ways to fill the grid with the capacity of 1 is the\
    \ sum of all the ways to fill the grid with the capacity of 1 by filling each\
    \ row and column with 1 unit of water, and you can either empty the row or column\
    \ by filling each cell with capacity - 1, and you can either empty the row or\
    \ column by filling each cell with capacity - 1, and so on.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The code I posted is just an implementation of the above idea. There are many\
    \ ways to implement the above idea, and I posted one that uses dynamic programming.\
    \ I hope this helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your explanation. Could you\
    \ please explain why you used the variable `ans` instead of `count`?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI used `ans` because I wanted to keep track of the number of ways to\
    \ fill the grid with the capacity of 1. I used `count` because I wanted to keep\
    \ track of the number of ways to fill the grid with the capacity of 2. So, `count`\
    \ will keep track of the number of ways to fill the grid with the capacity of\
    \ 1, and `", "{\n    long result = 0;\n    \n    for(int i = 0; i < grid.length;\
