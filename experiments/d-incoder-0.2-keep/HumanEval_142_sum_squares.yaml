    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThis is not the correct solution. `sum_squares` should return `0`\
    \ for `lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]` and not `-126`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI missed\
    \ that requirement. Thanks for pointing it out.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added a\
    \ solution that returns 0 when `lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Your solution returns `0` for `lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]` because `sum_squares`\
    \ returns `0` for `lst = [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]` because `lst[i] * lst[i]` is `0`.\n\
