    \ tags=c#,arrays |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm still a beginner at\
    \ C#, could you please explain what this line means? `long[] result = new long[guess.Length];`\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt creates an array of the same length as the guess array.\
    \ `long[] result = new long[guess.Length];` creates an array of length `guess.Length`\
    \ where each element is a `long`. So `result[0]` would be `0`, `result[1]` would\
    \ be `1`, etc.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your explanation. I'm still getting\
    \ an error when I try to run your code. `System.IndexOutOfRangeException: 'Index\
    \ was outside the bounds of the array.'` The error occurs on this line: `result[i]\
    \ = sum - diff;`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI forgot to mention that I used `long[] result\
    \ = new long[guess.Length];` instead of `long[] result = new long[game.Length];`\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited my answer to include a complete program that works.\
    \ I tested it and it works.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=c#,arrays |>\n<code>\nusing System;\n\
