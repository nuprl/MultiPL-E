  \ a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=sorting,arrays,c# |>\n<| c |>\nThis is not the right way to\
    \ solve the problem. He wants to sort by length and alphabetically by first letter.\
    \ Your solution sorts by length and then alphabetically by first letter.\n<|/\
