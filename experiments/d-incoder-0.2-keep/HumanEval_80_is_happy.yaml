    \ Then, we loop through the string again and check that the current character\
    \ is not equal to the next seven characters in the string. Then, we loop through\

    \ that the current character is not equal to the next nine characters in the string.\
    \ Then, we loop through the string again and check that the current character\
    \ is not equal to the next ten characters in the string. Then, we loop through\
    \ the string again and check that the current character is not equal to the next\
    \ eleven characters in the string. Then, we loop through the string again and\

    \ character is not equal to the next thirteen characters in the string. Then,\
