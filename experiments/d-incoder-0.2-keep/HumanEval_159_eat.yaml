    \ idea is to store the carrots eaten so far in a table and to remember how many\

    \ look up the number of carrots you have eaten so far and subtract that from the\
    \ number of carrots left to eat. \nThe table will look like this:\n<code>\ncarrots\

    \ `carrotsEaten` can be calculated as `carrots - carrots - carrotsEaten` without\

    \ For example, you can do `carrots -= carrotsNeeded;` before `carrots += carrotsNeeded;`\

    Thanks for your answer! I understand your solution, but I still don't understand\

    \ you eaten. `carrotsEaten` is the number of carrots eaten so far. `carrotsLeft\
    \ - carrotsEaten` is the remaining number of carrots left after you eaten. `carrotsEaten\
