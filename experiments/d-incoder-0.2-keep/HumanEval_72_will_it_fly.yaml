    \ written as \n<code>", "{\n    long maxWeight = w;\n    bool isBalanced = true;\n\

    \ of ways to fly, given that you can fly with any element of the array (except\
    \ the last one).\nThe base case is when N is 1, the table is filled with 1 for\
    \ all cells.\nThe recursive case is when N is 2, the table is filled with 1 for\
    \ the first cell and 0 for the second cell.\nThe recursive case is when N is 3,\
    \ the table is filled with 1 for the first cell, 1 for the second cell and 0 for\
    \ the third cell.\nThe recursive case is when N is 4, the table is filled with\
    \ 1 for the first cell, 1 for the second cell, 1 for the third cell and 0 for\
