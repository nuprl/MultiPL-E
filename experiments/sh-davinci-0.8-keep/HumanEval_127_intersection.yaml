prompt: "#!/bin/bash\n# You are given two intervals,\n# where each interval is a pair\
  \ of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n# The given intervals\
  \ are closed which means that the interval (start, end)\n# includes both start and\
  \ end.\n# For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal\
  \ its end.\n# Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these\
  \ two \n# intervals is a prime number.\n# Example, the intersection of the intervals\
  \ (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n# which its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n\
  # If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n# otherwise,\
  \ return \"NO\".\n# If the two intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\n# [input/output]\
  \ samples:\n# intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> \"NO\"\n# intersection((-1, 1), (0,\
  \ 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n# intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> \"YES\"\n#\n# $1 is a space-separated\
