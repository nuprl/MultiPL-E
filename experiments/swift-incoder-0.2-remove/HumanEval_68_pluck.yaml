prompt: "\n/// \"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative\
  \ integer nodes\n/// your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n///\
  \ The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n/// If multiple\
  \ nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest\
  \ index.\n/// The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its\
  \ index ],\n/// If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return\
  \ [].\n/// Example 1:\n/// Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has\
  \ the smallest index.\n/// Example 2:\n/// Explanation: 2 has the smallest even\
  \ value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n/// Example 3:\n/// Example 4:\n/// Explanation:\
  \ 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n/// so we will choose the\
  \ first zero, which has the smallest index.\n/// Constraints:\n/// * 1 <= nodes.length\
  \ <= 10000\n/// * 0 <= node.value\nfunc pluck(arr: [Int]) -> [Int] {\n"
