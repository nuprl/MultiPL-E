    Thanks for your answer! I tested it and it works. However, I wonder if there is\
    \ a more elegant solution. For example, `split` returns a `Vector`, so `map` returns\
    \ a `Vector`, so `join` returns a `Vector`, so `chars` returns a `Vector`, so\
    \ `res` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
    \ isLetter(x) then x.toUpper else x.toLower)` returns a `Vector`, so `chars.map(x=>if\
