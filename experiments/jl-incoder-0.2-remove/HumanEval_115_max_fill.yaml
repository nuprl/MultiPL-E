prompt: "\"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents\

  \   Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from\
  \ it, \n    and all buckets have the same capacity.\n    Your task is to use the\
  \ buckets to empty the wells.\n    Output the number of times you need to lower\

    \ programming is a technique that helps us solve problems such as these.\nThe\
    \ idea is to remember how we solved a problem before, and use that to solve the\
    \ same problem again.\nFor example, if we want to find the maximum value of a\
    \ function $f(x)$, we can remember the value of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$, and use these\
    \ to solve the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$.\nThe same\
    \ is true for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\nThe idea is that, if\
    \ we have solved the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$, we\
    \ will use the solution for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$ to solve\
    \ the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\nThis technique is\
    \ called memoization.\nThe idea is to store all of the solutions for $f(x)$ for\
    \ $x$ less than or equal to $0$ in a table, and use that table to solve the problem\
    \ for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$.\nThe table is called a memo\
    \ table, and it stores solutions for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$\
    \ in a hash table.\nThe hash table is called a memo hash table, and it stores\
    \ solutions for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$ in a hash table.\n\
    The idea is that, if we have solved the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or\
    \ equal to $0$, we will use the solution for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal\
    \ to $0$ to solve the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\n\
    The idea is that, if we have solved the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or\
    \ equal to $0$, we will use the solution for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal\
    \ to $0$ to solve the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\n\

    <text>\nPart C: Memoization\nA common data structure in computer science is the\
    \ memoization data structure. \nIt is a data structure that stores the results\
    \ of expensive function calls.\nThe memoization data structure is very useful\
    \ when solving problems where the same \nexpensive function call is performed\
    \ many times. \nFor example, if we were to implement the Fibonacci sequence in\
    \ Julia, \nwe would need to compute the Fibonacci sequence many times. \nIn order\
    \ to avoid computing the same sequence many times, \nwe could use a memoization\
