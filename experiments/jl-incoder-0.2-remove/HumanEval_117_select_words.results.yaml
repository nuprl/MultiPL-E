    <| c |>\nThanks for your answer! I tested your solution and it works perfectly.\
    \ However I do not understand why you used the type `Vector{String}` instead of\
    \ `Vector{String}[]`. I thought that `Vector{String}[]` would mean an array of\
    \ strings. Could you please explain why you used `Vector{String}[]` instead of\
    \ `Vector{String}`?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`Vector{String}[]` is an array of vectors\
    \ of strings. `Vector{String}` is an array of strings. So `Vector{String}[]` would\
    \ be an array of vectors of strings. `Vector{String}` would be an array of strings.\n\
