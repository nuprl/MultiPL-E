prompt: "\"\"\"\n    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the\
  \ greatest integer that is greater than \n    zero, and has a frequency greater\
  \ than or equal to the value of the integer itself. \n    The frequency of an integer\
  \ is the number of times it appears in the list.\n    If no such a value exist,\
