prompt: "\"\"\"Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression\n\
  \    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False\n\
  \    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have\
  \ the following format,\n    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and\
  \ denominator are positive whole numbers.\n\n    You can assume that x, and n are\
  \ valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\n\n                \"\"\"\
