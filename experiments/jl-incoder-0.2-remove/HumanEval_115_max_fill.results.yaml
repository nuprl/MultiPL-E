    \ programming is a technique that helps us solve problems such as these.\nThe\
    \ idea is to remember how we solved a problem before, and use that to solve the\
    \ same problem again.\nFor example, if we want to find the maximum value of a\
    \ function $f(x)$, we can remember the value of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$, and use these\
    \ to solve the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$.\nThe same\
    \ is true for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\nThe idea is that, if\
    \ we have solved the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$, we\
    \ will use the solution for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$ to solve\
    \ the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\nThis technique is\
    \ called memoization.\nThe idea is to store all of the solutions for $f(x)$ for\
    \ $x$ less than or equal to $0$ in a table, and use that table to solve the problem\
    \ for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$.\nThe table is called a memo\
    \ table, and it stores solutions for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$\
    \ in a hash table.\nThe hash table is called a memo hash table, and it stores\
    \ solutions for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal to $0$ in a hash table.\n\
    The idea is that, if we have solved the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or\
    \ equal to $0$, we will use the solution for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal\
    \ to $0$ to solve the problem for $f(x)$ for $x$ less than or equal to $0$.\n\

    \ equal to $0$, we will use the solution for $f(x)$ for $x$ greater than or equal\
