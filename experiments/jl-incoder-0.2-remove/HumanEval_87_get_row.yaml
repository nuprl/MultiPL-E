prompt: "\"\"\"\n    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,\n    which\
  \ is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n    each row may contain a different\
  \ number of columns.\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,\n\
  \    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n    each tuple\
  \ is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n    Sort coordinates initially\
  \ by rows in ascending order.\n    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns\
  \ in descending order.\n    \n    Examples:\n                \"\"\"\nfunction get_row(lst::Vector{Vector{Int64}},\
  \ x::Int64)::Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}} \n"
