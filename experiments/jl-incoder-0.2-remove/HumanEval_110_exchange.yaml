    This code does not work. `even = lst1[2:end]` will throw an error if lst1 has\
    \ less than 2 elements. `even = even[findall(x -> x % 2 == 0, even)]` will throw\
    \ an error if even is empty.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for pointing that out.\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. Your code works, but I wanted to know if\
    \ there is a way to do it without using sort. My code was too long and I wanted\
    \ to know if there is a way to do it without using sort.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I added a solution without sort\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI believe this should work:\n\
