    </code>\nYou can modify this code to meet your needs. You will need to add in\
    \ more code to detect when your cars collide, and this code is very naive.\n<|/\
    \ a tags=ruby |>\n<| c |>\nI wouldn't say this is \"very naive\" - it's very intuitive,\
    \ clear and easy to understand.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI think it's more a question\
    \ of graph theory. I'd use Floyd-Warshall: http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~srini/cs162/lectures/Floyd-Warshall.pdf\n\
    For each node I check if it's neighbor is already visited. Then, I add it to the\
    \ path I visit if it hasn't already been visited before.\n<|/ a dscore=1 tags=ruby\
    \ |>\n<| a tags=ruby dscore=0 |>\nI solved this problem and added a more general\
    \ version of the problem that allows a solution to be found for any number of\
    \ Cars.\nI used the same solution provided by. \nThe new solution works as follows:\n\
    For each Car, I keep a list of the neighboring Cars of the Car.\nIf there is a\
    \ neighboring Car, I will consider them as potential collisions and keep them\
    \ in a separate list. \nIf there are not neighboring Cars, I will consider them\
    \ as potential collisions, and I will take them in one place.\nTo check for potential\
    \ collisions, I used a Set, which only allows a given item to be added to it only\
    \ once. \n<code>\nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval < Test::Unit::TestCase\n\

    \ have to do with Ruby? You're asking how to fix a bug in some Ruby code.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis code has so many problems that it is hard to tell, what\
    \ you are trying to do, what the problems are.  I would suggest that you start\
    \ by defining your problem in much more detail.  For example: what is the behavior\
    \ you expect to see and how do you expect to implement it.  You might even get\
    \ some ideas as to how to proceed from that.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis isn't Ruby\
    \ code; it's pseudocode.  That's a great example of why SO questions are important.\
    \  It's great that you've written pseudocode, but that doesn't make it a Ruby\
    \ question.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nMy apologies, I thought it would be more Ruby\
    \ code than pseudocode. I'm actually new at this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI would\
    \ suggest that you step through the code in the debugger. \nIf you're using IRB\
    \ you could use 'rdebug' instead of 'irb'.\nThe other thing I would suggest is\
    \ that rather than putting everything on one line you probably should separate\
    \ your functions up into different files. That makes it easier to see the flow\
    \ of code.\n<|/ a tags=ruby dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the suggestion! I'm\
    \ still a beginner at this, but I'll definitely look into it now. Is there a tutorial\
    \ that explains how to step through code? I've used IRB and it seems like the\
    \ best way to go about this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWell, that's why I suggested\
    \ you step through it. The debugger will allow you to step through the code one\
    \ line at a time, and you can see what the values of each variable are. Basically\
    \ you would insert 'debugger' into the code you want to debug, and run it with\
    \ the debugger (`irb` will work too, but I prefer the debugger).\n<|/ c |>\n<|\

    \ car in the race starts off with exactly one leg. If I have \"race car with 10\
    \ legs\" (so 10 cars with 1 leg), and add more legs, then the total number of\
    \ cars *including the race car* will increase by more than one. In the case above\
    \ with 6 legs, I have 6+6=12 cars including the race car.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I'm sorry, I don't think your interpretation is correct. For example, if you have\
    \ two cars with 10 legs, then two cars with 2 legs, three cars with 4 legs, you\
    \ get 14+14+14+14=62 cars including the race car.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, you\
    \ are correct, I didn't see your answer. I edited my answer to account for the\
    \ possibility of a car starting off, with multiple legs, being involved in the\
    \ race. Thank you for your help.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nThis one is a bit\
    \ more general than the other solutions. I added a method called legs that returns\
    \ the number of legs of the car. Since it is based on a hash table, there could\
    \ be several cars with different legs (a hash table with more than one key is\
    \ usually used to store multiple values in a single key for a hash table). The\
    \ method also takes care of cars that start off with more than one leg. \n<code>\n\

    \ nice answer but I'm still not sure how this would apply to my situation. I'm\
    \ not quite sure how to translate what you said into my situation. I've updated\
    \ the code above to show what I'm dealing with, but I'm pretty new to programming.\
    \ How would I go about translating what you said into my code?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nI see, yes I understand what you're saying now. I think I understand your\
    \ second part now, but I'm still confused by your first part. How would I implement\
    \ this in my code?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Apologies, I forgot to mention this.\
    \ What I'm saying is that you need to apply the collision detection *in addition*\
    \ to the line simulation.  Your current code isn't doing that - it's only checking\
    \ for collisions with the car at the origin.  I suggest you add a line simulation\
    \ and apply the collision detection on it first, then you simulate the lines and\
    \ your cars. I'll write an edit showing you what I mean.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1\
    \ |>\nThe \"real\" answer is \"it depends\".  What is the distribution of speeds\
    \ that you are simulating for each car?  What are the distributions of distances,\
    \ times and speeds that you are simulating?  Is the car's speed random?  What\
    \ about collisions?\nI would say that one simple solution is to assign each car\
    \ a random speed, and keep track of how long it has been since the car was last\
    \ at that speed.  If a car's speed increases by a sufficient amount (probably\
    \ less than 1), they collide.  If a car's speed decreases by a sufficient amount,\
    \ they don't collide.  In fact, I would guess that if two cars move at different\
    \ speeds they will still collide, since they will travel at a different speed\
    \ if they collide.\nYou can calculate how long it has been since the car last\
    \ moved at that speed with the time function.  To keep track of a car's speed\
    \ at any time, just keep track of how long it has been since the car last moved\
    \ at that speed.  If you calculate how long it has been since the car last moved\
    \ at that speed, then the \nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval < Test::Unit::TestCase\n\

    Cars collide\" is a difficult problem to solve for a general case. Two cars are\
    \ both moving left to right and collide when they collide. As I said, it's not\
    \ too difficult to solve for small cases like this one, but as soon as you start\
    \ running into more complicated cases, you can get stuck trying to solve it for\
    \ two cars moving left to right and colliding when they collide. Also, your `car_race_collision`\
    \ function doesn't work for the case where there is only one car. It assumes the\
    \ cars are moving left to right, which they aren't in that case.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\

    \ This looks like the sort of thing I was hoping for. But this particular problem\
    \ is actually a lot simpler than my original question. My original problem was\
    \ actually an algorithm for finding all possible paths of length `n` from a set\
    \ of n nodes. I thought that this problem might be easier, because all you have\
    \ to do is find the paths of a certain length and then filter those paths by those\
    \ that don't include a node that has already been visited. Is this a fair assumption?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat sounds pretty reasonable to me. Even if that didn't apply\

    \ |>\nAs you commented, I don't think there is a simple way to find the path.\
    \ Even if there was, it's probably not efficient enough for you to write it yourself\
    \ (unless you already did this in another language, e.g. Python or Java).\nWhat\
    \ you might want to consider is writing a recursive backtracking algorithm. One\
    \ of the nice things about backtracking is that you can try all possibilities\
    \ without ever actually going to the same node twice. Here's an example where\
    \ I implemented a backtracking algorithm using recursion:\n<code>\nrequire 'test/unit'\n\
