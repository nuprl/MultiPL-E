prompt: "# We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n\
  # numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if\n\
  # it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing \n\
  # the following operation on the given array:\n# You are allowed to perform right\
  \ shift operation any number of times.\n# One right shift operation means shifting\
  \ all elements of the array by one\n# position in the right direction. The last\
  \ element of the array will be moved to\n# the starting position in the array i.e.\
  \ 0th index. \n# If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the\
  \ above operation\n# then return True else return False.\n# If the given array is\
  \ empty then return True.\n# Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\
  # For Example:\n# move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True\n# Explanation: By performin\
  \ 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n# be achieved for the given\
  \ array.\n# move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False\n# Explanation:It is not possible\

    \ allowed to perform a right shift of the array, you can easily see that for any\

    \ to move 2 down (2 shifted left by 1) and rearrange the rest of the array in\
    \ the way shown above. You can do this in O(n) time by checking if there are two\
    \ consecutive elements (two shift operations required) and if so you can either\
    \ shift both elements and rearrange the rest or shift only one of the elements\
    \ left and leave the rest untouched.\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nYes, but we\

    \ a subarray that is smaller than the pivot (the element in the middle of the\
    \ array), and two subarrays that are larger than the pivot. The recursive calls\

    <|/ a dscore=2 tags=sorting,algorithm,ruby,arrays |>\n<| a dscore=2 |>\nThis problem\
    \ can be solved with some of basic mathematics and a bit of code. First we start\
    \ with some assumptions. We know that there is an n amount of numbers in the array,\
    \ and we know the size of the array is at least 3. We know that the first and\
    \ last item in the array cannot change place. Our initial assumption is that there\
    \ exist 2 numbers that we can swap to achieve a sorted array. Now we use the following\
    \ process to find the two numbers that we can swap to achieve a sorted array:\n\
    We know that if the first number is greater than the second number, we can swap\
    \ them and if the first number is smaller than the second number, we cannot. Now\
    \ we know that our two numbers must remain greater than the original number. Since\
    \ we know that there are 3 numbers to swap to create a sorted array, we can just\
    \ swap the first number with our second number. This gives us the following process:\n\
    We swap our first number with the second number. Now the array is sorted. Next\
    \ we swap the second number with our third number. This gives us the following\
    \ process:\nWe swap our second number with the third number. Now the array is\

    \ the following process:\nWe swap our third number with the fourth number. Now\

    \ gives us the following process:\nWe swap our fourth number with the fifth number.\

    \ This gives us the following process:\nWe swap our fifth number with the first\

    \ to help future readers :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=algorithm |>\nI assume that the\
    \ input array is sorted, and that it is guaranteed that there are no duplicates\
    \ (otherwise, there would be a way to make an ordered array out of it).\nNow,\
    \ consider two cases: one in which you know that arr[1] contains all elements\
    \ from 0 to n-1, and one in which you know that arr[1] contains all elements from\
    \ n-1 to n. In both cases, the only operation that can make arr[1] contain all\
    \ the elements from 0 to n-1 is the right shift operation.\nNow, if there are\
    \ duplicates in arr[1], you cannot make any change to the array, and you cannot\
    \ make any change to a smaller array by performing a right shift operation in\
    \ which you shift all the elements of the smaller array one position to the right.\
    \ Then, you cannot make any change to the smaller array by performing a right\
    \ shift operation in which you shift all the elements of the smaller array one\
    \ position to the right, but you still cannot make any change to the smaller array\
    \ by performing a right shift operation in which you shift all the elements of\
    \ the smaller array one position to the right. In both cases, you are guaranteed\
    \ that no further changes can be made to arr[1].\nTherefore, you must conclude\
    \ that if you perform a right shift operation on each element of arr[1], you can\
    \ sort the whole array.\nGiven the fact that the input array is sorted, this means,\
    \ that you only need to perform the right shift operation on the first n elements\
    \ of the array (because you cannot make any change to the array otherwise).\n\
    To determine whether you need to perform a right shift operation, you only need\
    \ to keep track of the number of elements in the array.\nIn pseudo-code, this\
    \ looks something like this:\n<code>\nbool isSorted(arr) {\n  for i in range(0,\
