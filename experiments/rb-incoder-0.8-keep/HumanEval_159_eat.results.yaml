    \ need but I don't think it works as I need it. I updated the example in the question.\
    \ I don't think your algorithm counts down to the next carrot, but instead it\
    \ just counts down until it hits zero. Is there a way to make it count down until\
    \ it hits the next carrot? Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHi, yes that is a\

    \ c |>\nYou don't need to have `@carrots` and `@carrots_left` as instance variables.\
    \ You can pass them as arguments to the function `eat` - so you just have `def\
    \ eat(number, need, remaining)`. Also you don't need the local variables - you\
    \ can just return the required values as an array.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI didn't.\

    \ defined instance variables `@carrots` and `@carrots_left` before using them.\
    \ But in general it's not good practice. Try running your code in a different\
    \ environment. It will still work because ruby won't create a new local variable\
    \ unless the local variable is referenced or assigned. If you assign a new local\
    \ variable `@carrots` before using `@carrots`, then `@carrots` won't be updated.\n\
