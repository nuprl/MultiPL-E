    \ c |>\nMy point is that you can tell that it's an inject with a block that modifies\
    \ the sum, and that the block takes a single argument (the element to add), and\
    \ that `inject` is the \"loop\" that does this - it's fairly obvious. `inject`\
    \ has become a standard method in Ruby since it has been around for over 20 years,\
    \ and it's trivial to find an example that does what it's designed to do.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| a |>\nHere's a way to do it using inject:\n<code>", "  # Create a list\
    \ with the value of x at index 1 subtracted from x at index 0 multiplied by the\
    \ value at index 1\n  xs.reverse!\n  derivative_result = xs[1] - xs[0] * xs[1]\n\
    \  xs.reverse!\n  xs.inject(:*) # multiply the first term by the first and second\
    \ terms\n  xs.inject(xs[0], :+) # add the first term to the first and second term\n\
    \  xs.inject(derivative_result, :*) # multiply by the derivative of the first\
    \ term to get the second term\nend\n</code>\nThis could be condensed by using\
    \ a map call and a block return, but it's much less readable.\n<|/ a dscore=1\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThis doesn't seem to work if I enter `derivative([3,1,2,4,5])`\
    \ into the terminal.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI just edited my code to reflect the\
    \ bug in `derivative`. As it stands, the code works as expected in Ruby 2.3.0.\
    \ Do you know if you're using a different version of Ruby?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I am using ruby 2.5.0.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh wow. That's very strange. Maybe\
    \ it's different in how it does `inject`. It's been a while since I used Ruby,\
    \ and I thought `inject` was the equivalent to `each` for arrays. Sorry for the\
    \ mistake.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nUsing a method from here:\n<code>", " \
    \ d = [0] * xs.length\n  d[0] = x[1]\n  for i in 1..xs.length\n    d[i] = xs[i-1]\
    \ * d[i-1]\n  end\n  d\nend", "  return [1, 0] + xs\nend", "  product = 1\n  for\
    \ x in xs\n    product *= x\n  end\n  product\nend", "  x2 = xs.each_cons(2).map\
    \ {|xs, xs| xs.reduce(:+) }\n  x2[0] + (x2[1] ** 2).reduce(:+) # sum of squared\
