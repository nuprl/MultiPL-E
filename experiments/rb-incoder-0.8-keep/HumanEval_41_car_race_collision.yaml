    \ version of the problem that allows a solution to be found for any number of\
    \ Cars.\nI used the same solution provided by. \nThe new solution works as follows:\n\
    For each Car, I keep a list of the neighboring Cars of the Car.\nIf there is a\
    \ neighboring Car, I will consider them as potential collisions and keep them\
    \ in a separate list. \nIf there are not neighboring Cars, I will consider them\
    \ as potential collisions, and I will take them in one place.\nTo check for potential\
    \ collisions, I used a Set, which only allows a given item to be added to it only\

    \ have to do with Ruby? You're asking how to fix a bug in some Ruby code.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis code has so many problems that it is hard to tell, what\
    \ you are trying to do, what the problems are.  I would suggest that you start\
    \ by defining your problem in much more detail.  For example: what is the behavior\
    \ you expect to see and how do you expect to implement it.  You might even get\
    \ some ideas as to how to proceed from that.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis isn't Ruby\
    \ code; it's pseudocode.  That's a great example of why SO questions are important.\
    \  It's great that you've written pseudocode, but that doesn't make it a Ruby\
    \ question.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nMy apologies, I thought it would be more Ruby\
    \ code than pseudocode. I'm actually new at this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI would\
    \ suggest that you step through the code in the debugger. \nIf you're using IRB\
    \ you could use 'rdebug' instead of 'irb'.\nThe other thing I would suggest is\
    \ that rather than putting everything on one line you probably should separate\
    \ your functions up into different files. That makes it easier to see the flow\
    \ of code.\n<|/ a tags=ruby dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the suggestion! I'm\
    \ still a beginner at this, but I'll definitely look into it now. Is there a tutorial\
    \ that explains how to step through code? I've used IRB and it seems like the\
    \ best way to go about this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWell, that's why I suggested\
    \ you step through it. The debugger will allow you to step through the code one\
    \ line at a time, and you can see what the values of each variable are. Basically\
    \ you would insert 'debugger' into the code you want to debug, and run it with\
    \ the debugger (`irb` will work too, but I prefer the debugger).\n<|/ c |>\n<|\

    \ c |>\nVery cool! This looks like the sort of thing I was hoping for. But this\
    \ particular problem is actually a lot simpler than my original question. My original\
    \ problem was actually an algorithm for finding all possible paths of length `n`\
    \ from a set of n nodes. I thought that this problem might be easier, because\
    \ all you have to do is find the paths of a certain length and then filter those\
    \ paths by those that don't include a node that has already been visited. Is this\
    \ a fair assumption?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat sounds pretty reasonable to me.\
    \ Even if that didn't apply to your problem, you could easily adapt my algorithm.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nAs you commented, I don't think there is a simple\
    \ way to find the path. Even if there was, it's probably not efficient enough\
    \ for you to write it yourself (unless you already did this in another language,\
    \ e.g. Python or Java).\nWhat you might want to consider is writing a recursive\
    \ backtracking algorithm. One of the nice things about backtracking is that you\
    \ can try all possibilities without ever actually going to the same node twice.\
