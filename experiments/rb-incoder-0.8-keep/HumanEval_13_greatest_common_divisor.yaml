    \ since I never really thought about the problem before, and while I was happy\
    \ to learn some new syntax and semantics, I wasn't happy with the efficiency of\
    \ either of my solutions (I suspect that my second one would be faster, but I\
    \ had to test it). A quick test showed that my implementation was a bit slower,\
    \ but I think that's mostly because the function greatest_common_divisor(a, b)\
    \ was defined outside of the method, but I still think this solution is faster\
    \ than the one I gave first. However, this is just my speculation. As such, I\
    \ would still recommend using my first solution, or at least using my second solution\
    \ before making this a concern.\nAs far as learning more, I have heard good things\
    \ about Programming Pearls and I highly recommend reading about functional programming,\
    \ specifically about recursive functions. I would also recommend reading about\
    \ iterative programming, specifically about for loops and while loops. There are\
    \ some great videos by MIT called Purely Functional Data Structures, with which\
    \ I highly recommend watching, but also check out Real World Functional Programming\
    \ by Frank Henderson. Also, if you want to learn about other programming languages,\
    \ there's also a great series on YouTube called Functional Programming for Ruby.\
