    \ you for your help! I think your answer is close to what I need but I don't think\
    \ it works as I need it. I updated the example in the question. I don't think\
    \ your algorithm counts down to the next carrot, but instead it just counts down\
    \ until it hits zero. Is there a way to make it count down until it hits the next\

    \ create a new local variable if it is not already present. Your code may work\
    \ because you haven't defined instance variables `@carrots` and `@carrots_left`\
