    \ algorithm by hand, then translate it into Ruby.\nFor example, the algorithm\
    \ would be something like this:\n<code>", "   min_sum = 0\n   for i in q\n   \
    \   if min_sum < i\n         min_sum = i\n      if w-min_sum > 0\n         return\

    \ do |item, index|\n    if item > max_sum\n      max_sum = item\n    end\n  end\n\
    \  weights.each_with_index do |item, index|\n    item = item - max_sum\n    if\
    \ item < 0\n      return false\n    end\n  end\n  return true\nend\n</code>\n\

    \ using an extra variable which keeps track of the maximum sum possible for the\
    \ list. \n<code>", "  max = w.to_i\n  i = 1\n  while i < q.length && max >= q[i].to_i\n\

    \ list is.\nIn palindromic lists, all elements within a list are of the same type,\
    \ and the list is a palindromic if the elements are of the same type and the list\
    \ is a palindrome if the elements are of the same type and the list is a palindrome\
    \ if their orders are equal. In a palindromic list q:", "  if w < 0 or q.nil?\

    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nWhat is the point of the ternary operator\

    \ I decided to put it in a single line with some comments, so it would be easier\

    I understand, I'm just not used to the ternary operator so I wanted to understand\
    \ it better and how to improve the code. Your code looks a bit more readable than\
    \ mine. Thank you!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're welcome! The ternary operator can\
    \ be very useful for reducing your code length and repetitions.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ a tags=ruby,ruby-on-rails |>\nThis problem can be solved without using ternary\
    \ operator or any other operator except if conditions. \n<code>", "  return q.length\
    \ == 0 && w.zero? || (q.size == 0 && w.zero? || q == reverse(w.to_a))\nend\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThe function `reverse` is unnecessary.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a tags=ruby,algorithm |>\nI made this solution:\n<code>", "  return q.length\
    \ == w && q.reverse == q.to_a.reverse.sort.join\nend\n</code>\nSo it works like\
    \ this: you have a list of integers, and you are asked to determine whether you\
    \ can fly, with the condition that you have a maximum of w weight. You have no\
    \ maximum, but you do have a list of balanced integers. If your list is balanced,\
    \ the sum of the integers must add up to w.\nNow this might be a bit confusing.\
    \ Let's try it on a few examples:\n<code>\np will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) #=> true\n\
    p will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) #=> false\np will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) #=> true\np will_it_fly([3],\
    \ 5) #=> true\np will_it_fly([1], 5) #=> true\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThank\
    \ you so much for taking the time to explain this to me! I appreciate it very\
    \ much.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI am glad to have helped. Happy coding!\n<|/ c |>\n\

    \ q.sum == max_possible_weight && n == m\n    end\n  end\n  q.sum == max_possible_weight\n\
