    \ What I ended up doing was to create an array which would store if an account\
    \ was under zero and use that to loop through and determine if the account was\
    \ under zero (basically just like my code above). But what would be the advantage\
    \ of using your solution? I don't see it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe advantage is\
    \ simplicity. If you need to go through many accounts, your function becomes quite\
    \ complicated. If you need to go through just one account, your function becomes\
    \ quite simple.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh yes, that's a good point. I ended up using\
    \ your solution, but I'm just curious what was wrong with mine above, haha. I\
    \ just want to understand what's wrong with the above code.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Your solution didn't work for me because when the function was running through\
    \ the list again, it would never see that it was under zero. So when it came to\
    \ the second `-1` it was always returning `true`. However, with my solution, whenever\
    \ `below_zero` was run with the next `operation` it would've returned `true` because\
    \ `below_zero` would have been called again.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh! I see what\
    \ you're saying. Thanks for the explanation! But I don't understand what would\
    \ be wrong with my solution in the first place. I thought it would be more readable\
    \ and easier since I wasn't using recursion at all. But it seems like it actually\
    \ makes things complicated?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\n<code>", "  operations.each\
