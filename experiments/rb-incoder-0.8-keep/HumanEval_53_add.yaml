    \ add adds two numbers. If you pass two numbers as arguments then the first number\
    \ is added to the second number and so on. In the function call, add(2, 3) this\
    \ means add with two arguments: 2 and 3. The first argument is the x and the second\
    \ argument is the y. The return statement of the function is then returned from\
    \ the function call.\nWhat is happening in the function add is called recursion.\
    \ The first statement is if a == 0 then return b else add(a, b - 1). This line\
    \ adds the first two numbers. Now the second statement is if b == 0 then return\
    \ c else add(b, c - 1). The line add(5, 7) means add with two arguments: 5 and\
    \ 7. The first argument is the x and the second argument is the y. The return\
    \ statement of the function call then is returned by the function call. The function\
    \ add then calls itself again, but with the other two numbers. So the function\
    \ call add(5, 7) will add 5 and 7. 5 is added to the first number (5 - 1), so\
    \ 6 is added and 7 is added to 6 (7 - 1). Now the function call add(6, 4) will\
    \ add 6 and 4. So 6 is added to the first number (6 - 1), which is 5 and 7 is\
    \ added to the 5 (5 - 1), which is 6 and 7 is added to the 6 (6 - 1) which is\
    \ 7, which is returned by the function call. So in total, 7 will be added and\
    \ returned.\nWhat about factorial?\nThe factorial function adds two numbers together\
    \ to give the factorial of the two numbers. The first statement is if a == 0 then\
    \ return 1 which is 1 (because 1 is the factorial of 0). The function call factorial(4)\
    \ will call factorial(3) since 3 > 0 and factorial(3) will call factorial(2) since\
    \ 2 > 0 and factorial(2) will call factorial(1) since 1 > 0 and factorial(1) will\
    \ call factorial(0) since 0 is equal to 1, which is returned. So factorial(4)\
    \ will return 4.\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| a tags=recursion,algorithm dscore=1 |>\n\
