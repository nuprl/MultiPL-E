    \ not return the expected result. The problem requires to find number of times\
    \ you should lower the bucket capacity in order to fill all the wells. So when\
    \ you have a 5x5 grid and the bucket capacity is 5, you should lower it to 4 (because\
    \ you can fill 4 cells with water in each row). \nAnd if your grid is 5x5 and\
    \ there are 3 wells, you need only two times to empty the bucket.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI just edited my answer, I added a function that returns the correct\
    \ number\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe code you added returns incorrect result, if you\
    \ try the test case with capacity 5, it should return 4 as you said\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYes but the test case you provided in your answer should be `[[1,0,0],\
    \ [1,0,0], [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,1]]` the answer is 4 because that is the number\
    \ of times to lower bucket capacity in order to fill all the wells.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 tags=dynamic-programming,ruby,algorithm |>\nSo if our goal is to\
    \ find the maximum cost we can get to fill in a well, we have a similar problem\
    \ as before except that our goal is to find the minimum cost we can get to fill\
    \ in a well which can be expressed as a permutation with 1 where we put water\
    \ in and 0 where we don't.\nTo solve this problem we only have to consider ways\
    \ we can fill a well until we get to one. Since our wells are square, we can be\
    \ sure we can fill a well in the first row and column. Now we can either fill\
    \ the whole well or we can split it into two wells one being the top half and\
    \ one being the bottom half. If we split it into two wells we can fill the top\
    \ half in the first row and the bottom half in the second row. Since we know we\
    \ can fill a well with water in either the top or bottom half, we know we can\
    \ fill the entire well by filling two wells or by filling one well.\nIf there\
    \ are two wells that you can fill with water in any row/column, you can then fill\
    \ them both or you can only fill one well in the row or column. To solve the above\
    \ problem we only have to consider two ways of filling a well. We can either fill\
    \ both wells in any row/column or only fill in one well in the row or column.\

    I think you can find optimal solution by adding `while left != right` in the `while`\
    \ loop for finding shortest path between `left` and `right`. Then you can find\
    \ that path will have the least amount of cells to fill up. [see here for details](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-fill-grid/discuss/7143/How-can-we-find-the-longest-path-from-a-given-cell-to-the-left-most-cell-in-the-grid?tab=oldest#reply-31651)\n\

    \ order to count how many times a bucket has been empty we simply iterate over\
    \ the matrix and increment the corresponding counter by one. We also need to store\
    \ the counter of the bucket where the current cell is located. So in order to\
    \ know which bucket to empty we simply iterate over the matrix and get the bucket\
    \ where the current cell is located and increment the counter for that bucket.\n\
    Now that we know which bucket to empty we can iterate over the matrix and empty\
    \ the bucket. Since we know how many times a bucket has been empty we can simply\
    \ decrement this counter and empty the current bucket if the counter is less than\

    Thank you for answering. I can't seem to understand why you would multiply by\
    \ capacity and subtract by buckets. What exactly is happening here?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThe result of `grid.count(&:empty?)` represents the number of wells that\
    \ have 0 capacity. `buckets` is the number of the buckets, and the capacity is\
    \ what capacity is to the power of the number of buckets. For example, the number\
    \ of buckets is 3, and capacity is 1, so you need to empty 2 wells and 3 buckets,\
    \ and `buckets` is 3, so we need to subtract `2`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe formula\
    \ is `number_of_buckets - number_of_empty_buckets`, so `numberOfBuckets - numberOfEmptyBuckets`,\
    \ and we can use multiplication to find the number of empty buckets. However,\
    \ we also need to subtract capacity from it to get the number of non-empty buckets.\
    \ That's the formula that I used above.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh I see. So this\
    \ would actually be `number_of_buckets - (capacity * number_of_empty_buckets)`\
    \ right?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes; the number of non-empty buckets is (number of\
    \ non-empty wells - number of empty wells)*capacity. But this formula is more\
    \ concise: `numberOfEmptyBuckets = (numberOfWells - numberOfEmptyWells) * capacity`.\n\

    \ answer is the correct answer for the original question. Thanks ! I edited my\

    \ same answer when working with rectangles and grid problems. So I think that\
    \ the question itself is still valid.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks. This is quite\

    \ with rows and columns, but I wonder why you are using +1 for the second dimensions?\n\

    The solution above uses recursion to count the number of times you can empty the\
    \ buckets. \n<code>\n(grid[i][j] == 1).each do |j|\n            if grid[i][j]\
    \ == 1\n                count = count + 1\n                grid[i][j] = 0\n  \
    \              count = count - bucket_capacity\n                break\n      \
    \      end\n        end\n</code>\nThis loop counts the number of empty buckets.\n\
    <code>\ncount = count - 1\n</code>\nThis line removes the number of empty buckets\
    \ from the total number of empty buckets.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThis is amazing!!\

    \ you! This was very helpful. Your solution worked for the most part, but I was\

    \ when I have this array: [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], and my bucket_capacity = 5, my answer\
    \ comes out to 6. Would you know what might be the problem with that?\n<|/ c |>\n\
