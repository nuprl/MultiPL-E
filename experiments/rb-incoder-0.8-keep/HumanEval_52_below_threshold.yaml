    This is not the answer to your question (how to determine if all the elements\
    \ of a list are below a certain threshold), but you may find it helpful in some\
    \ other situations.  \nIn some cases, it is useful to see which elements of a\
    \ list are above or below a threshold.  In those cases, you just want to know\
    \ that every element in the list is above or below the threshold.  The following\
    \ is one such situation:\n<code>", "  l.all? { |i| i < t }\nend", "  return l.all?\
    \ {|n| n < t}\nend", "  return l.all? {|x| x > t}\nend", "  l.each { |e| return\

    \ I used the variable l to refer to the list itself and l to refer to the elements\
    \ of the list. \nThe idea is that the first line sorts the list l (by changing\
    \ only the first element and the last element of the list to t) and the second\
    \ line checks if all elements of the list are above the threshold t. If so, then\

    \ |>\nThanks for the solution. But, I believe it would be better to use the enumerable\

    \ will always return `true` or `false`, regardless of your condition.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYes, you are right. My mistake. I was confused about the return type\

    \ do you find out if all array elements are less then some number. \nTo do so\
    \ you can use inject. \n<code>\n[1,2,3,4,5].inject(:<)\n</code>\nwill return you\
    \ either 0 or 1. If all values are less than 0 then it returns 0.\n<|/ a dscore=0\
    \ |>\n<| a tags=ruby |>\nAnother method would be to count the number of elements\
    \ that are less than the threshold and compare the count with the length of the\
    \ array:\n<code>", "  l.all? {|x| x < t }\nend", "  l.each do |x|\n    return\
    \ false if x < t\n  end\n  true\nend\n</code>\nNote that it is generally bad practice\
    \ to leave out a return statement. There are exceptions to this, but I think this\
    \ is a good example of when you might want to leave out a return statement.\n\
    The Ruby idiom for looping through a collection in such a way that you can stop\
    \ early is to use Enumerator#detect as shown above:\n<code>\nbelow_threshold([1,\
    \ 2, 4, 10], 100).detect { |x| x < 100 }", "  l.all? { |x| (t >= x) }\nend", " \
    \ return l.all? { |v| v < t }\nend", "  l.all? do |x|\n    x >= t\n  end\nend",
  "  l.all? { |x| x <= t }\nend", "  l.all? { |x| x < t }\nend", "  l.sort! # Sort\
    \ in ascending order\n  return t.nil? || (t<l.last)\nend", "  l.sort.each do |n|\n\
    \    return false if (n-t).abs <= t && (t-n).abs <= t\n  end\n  return true\n\

    \ of a hackish way. `all?` calls `===` internally, which could lead to unexpected\
