    <text>\nNow we will make our own version of compare which works over collections\
    \ and uses reduce to apply a function to each element in the collection.\nIt is\
    \ important that we use reduce to solve the problem rather than a for loop (as\
    \ we are doing in this exercise) as it reduces the complexity of the problem (we\
    \ are no longer iterating over the entire collection but rather reducing the set\
    \ of items that we must examine). The reduce function takes a collection of items\
    \ and a function (or block) that accepts an item and returns another item. In\
    \ this case we need a function that takes a single argument and reduces over an\
    \ array. Here we define such a function:\nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval\

    \ for each loop to iterate over each score and guess:\n<code>\nscores.each do\
    \ |score|\n  guesses.each do |guess|\n    if score == guess\n      score += 0\n\

    \ here is that we iterate through the first list to get the score for each index\
    \ in the second list. When you iterate through the first list again to get the\
    \ next index, the result should be the same. \nThe idea is simple. Take the first\
    \ index from the first list. If the item at that index is equal to the item at\
    \ that index from the second list, then add that score to the current score and\
    \ continue. If they're not equal, then add the difference between the two scores.\n\

    thank you for your answer, I've made some tests and I believe your code returns\
    \ the same value as mine, it's just slower and the test result are different.\
    \ Thank you for your answer anyway I appreciate it. Your code returns an array\
    \ of the same length as my array where each value is a difference between 2 elements\
    \ of the array. My array is an array of integers and I need an another array with\
    \ the same length as my array where each value is the difference between 2 numbers\
    \ of the array (so it's a difference between 2 array elements)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nSorry for the misunderstanding, I misread the question. I was thinking of\
    \ the differences between the elements in both arrays and this was how I interpreted\
    \ the question initially. I will update the answer with what I believe is the\
    \ correct interpretation.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI updated my answer with what I\
    \ think should be the correct solution\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI did some tests and\
    \ it works fine but it's a bit slow and I don't know why. I have an array of 131\
    \ elements and I put a break point in my function and it breaks when I test the\
    \ first element of the array. I guess there is something that makes it slow but\
    \ I don't know why, I put a break point at `while i < game.length and j < guess.length`\
    \ and it breaks when I test the 1st element of the array. It's a total of only\
    \ 10 tests so the program will break on this first test, it takes about 1 second\
    \ to execute the function, but I still think it's too slow and don't know why\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think your function is definitely slower than mine but I\
    \ don't understand why. Maybe the test is not good enough and I have to find a\
