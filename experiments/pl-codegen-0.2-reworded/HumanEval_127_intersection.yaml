prompt: "# You are given two intervals,\n# where each interval is a pair of integers.\
  \ For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n# The given intervals are closed\
  \ which means that the interval (start, end)\n# includes both start and end.\n#\
  \ For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.\n\
  # Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two \n#\
  \ intervals is a prime number.\n# Example, the intersection of the intervals (1,\
  \ 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n# which its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n# If\
  \ the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n# otherwise,\
  \ return \"NO\".\n# If the two intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\n# [input/output]\
  \ samples:\n# >>> intersection([1, 2], [2, 3])\n# \"NO\"\n# >>> intersection([-1,\
  \ 1], [0, 4])\n# \"NO\"\n# >>> intersection([-3, -1], [-5, 5])\n# \"YES\"\nsub intersection\
