prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive\
  \ integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the\
  \ range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\
  \n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n\
  \    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n\
  \    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n\
  \    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells\
  \ (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path\
  \ A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after making\
  \ the ordered vectors of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through (let's\
  \ call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than lst_B, in\
  \ other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such that lst_A[i]\
  \ < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It\
  \ is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n    Return an ordered vector of the\
  \ values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n\n    Examples:    \n \
  \   >>> minPath([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)\n    [1, 2, 1]\n\n    >>>\
  \ minPath([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1)\n    [1]\n    \"\"\"\nfunction minPath(grid::Vector{Vector{Int64}},\
  \ k::Int64)::Vector{Int64} \n"
