prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted vector that has the\
  \ odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture\
  \ in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any\
  \ positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as\
  \ follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the\
  \ previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n\
  \    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence\
  \ will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2.\
  \ returned vector sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5)\
  \ returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd\
  \ numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n    [1, 5]\n    \"\"\"\
