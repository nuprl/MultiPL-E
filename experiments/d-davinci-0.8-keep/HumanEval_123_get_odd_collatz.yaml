prompt: "import std.typecons;\nimport std.math;\n/*\n\n    Given a positive integer\
  \ n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The\
  \ Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n\
  \    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from\
  \ the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term\
  \ is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next\
  \ term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter\
  \ what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1)\
  \ is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n\
  \    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8,\
  \ 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \n*/\nlong[] get_odd_collatz(long\
