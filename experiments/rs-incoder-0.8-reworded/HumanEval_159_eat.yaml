prompt: "/// You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of\
  \ carrots,\n/// but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n\
  /// you should return a vector of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n\
  /// the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n/// if there are not enough remaining\
  \ carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n/// Example:\n\
  /// >>> eat(5, 6, 10)\n/// vec![11, 4]\n/// >>> eat(4, 8, 9)\n/// vec![12, 1]\n\
  /// >>> eat(1, 10, 10)\n/// vec![11, 0]\n/// >>> eat(2, 11, 5)\n/// vec![7, 0]\n\
