prompt: "# I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\

  \ \n# Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If\
  \ they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute\
  \ difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\n# compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])\
  \ -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n# compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\ncompare\
