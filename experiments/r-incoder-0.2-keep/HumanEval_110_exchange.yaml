prompt: "# In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of\
  \ numbers,\n# and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\n\
  # between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n# There is no limit on\
  \ the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n# If it is possible to\
  \ exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n# all the elements of lst1\
  \ to be even, return \"YES\".\n# Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n# For example:\n# exchange([1,\
  \ 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n# exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) =>\
  \ \"NO\"\n# It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\nexchange <- function(lst1,\
