      "program": "-- I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n-- event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n-- definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n-- Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n-- You are given two tables of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n-- Return a table of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n-- the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n-- example:\n-- >>> compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])\n-- [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n-- >>> compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])\n-- [4,4,1,0,0,6]\nlocal function compare(game, guess)\n    local table = {}\n    for i=1,#
