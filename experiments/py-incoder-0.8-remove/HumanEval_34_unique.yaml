    The unique function above uses a set object to remove duplicates. We'll take a\
    \ look at a few examples to explain this. Here are some examples of how it works:\n\

    \ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8})\n</cell>\n<text>\nThe first example makes sense.\
    \ {1, 2, 3, 4} is a set of numbers. The set does not contain any duplicates. However,\
    \ the second example has duplicates. {1, 2, 3} is also a set. {1} is a unique\
    \ element in the set. The set {1, 2, 3} contains 3 elements. This example shows\
    \ how to use the unique function with a list. It also shows how to use the unique\
    \ function with a set. The unique function works with both types of objects. As\
    \ a result, you can always pass your variables in to the function as either a\
    \ list or a set object.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\n1.3 Python Lists to Python Sets\n\

    \ The third example does not make sense. The first example returns unique numbers.\
