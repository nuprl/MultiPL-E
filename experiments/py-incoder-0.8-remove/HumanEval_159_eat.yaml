    </cell>\n<text>\nDay 6: Pig Latin\nNow that you have seen the eat function, it's\
    \ time to write a function called pig_latin\nThe function takes as input a string,\
    \ and returns the input string with each word capitalized.\nIf your string starts\
    \ with a vowel, then the function should capitalize the first letter of the word.\n\
    If the word starts with a consonant, then it needs to add \"ay\" to the end.\n\
    \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \"apple\"\nOutput: \"Apple\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \"\
    puppy\"\nOutput: \"Puppy\"\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: \"in\"\nOutput: \"Inay\"\n\n\
    Example 4:\n\nInput: \"mad\"\nOutput: \"Maday\"\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: \"leetcode\"\
    \nOutput: \"Leetcodeay\"\n\nExample 6:\n\nInput: \"leet\"\nOutput: \"Lettayay\"\
