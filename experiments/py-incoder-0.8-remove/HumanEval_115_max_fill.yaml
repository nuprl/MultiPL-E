    \ of the points that player has received so far.\nThe capacity is the number of\

    \ be given a list of players who are scorers and a list of players who are captains.\n\
    The list will be sorted by score in ascending order.\nReturn the number of players\

    The problem is really quite simple. Start with the largest well, empty it by filling\
    \ it in with as much water as possible. Continue until all wells are empty and\
    \ you have a minimum amount of water left in the buckets.\nIf you have n wells,\
    \ and m buckets, the solution is O((n+m)*lg(n+m)). This is because you can use\
    \ the bucket to fill each well exactly once.\nThe idea is to use the following\
    \ recurrence relation (which is equivalent to the Fibonacci sequence where fib(n)\
    \ = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) for n>=2):\n\nf(0) = 0, f(1) = 1\nf(n) = 2n\n\nThen we\
    \ can solve the problem as follows (in pseudo-code, you can easily adapt this\
    \ code to python):\n<code>", "    num_row = len(grid)\n    num_col = len(grid[0])\n\

    \ line - ```buckets = [[] for _ in range(K)]```\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSo what exactly\
    \ is happening in the 2nd line here? I am unable to find any explanations for\
    \ the same.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`buckets` is a list consisting of `K` empty lists.\
    \ If you print `buckets` it will print `[[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]`\
    \ where `K` is the number of buckets. So what happens here is that `buckets[i]`\
    \ will return all the elements in bucket `i` in the order they were in the list\
    \ initially. So `buckets[i][0]` returns the first element in the ith bucket (which\
    \ is an empty list).\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=3 |>\nAs a complement to the other\

    I guess that would be a tradeoff. In the worst case, you can have your whole grid\
    \ un-counted, which is going to be slower than keeping track of the counts. I\
    \ imagine the approach above would still be faster (though, I also have to say\
    \ that I'm not super familiar with the data structure that you're using).\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, if you keep track of counts, you would have to iterate over\
    \ each cell to make sure each is cleared, which would make it slower.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYou mean that if I keep track of counts, I could have a much smaller\
    \ grid, and only count cells that have been cleared, which would make it faster?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI suppose that could work. You'd have to make an initial pass\
    \ through the grid of counts, and then iterate over each cell and increment the\
    \ count if that cell was zero. At least, that's how I'd go about it.\n<|/ c |>\n\

    \ $n$ columns. We have $n$ buckets and $m$ rows. So $m$ multiplications and $n$\

    \ be performed is $O(m * n)$. \nThe total number of times that we need to fill\
    \ the bucket is $O(n^2)$, since we iterate through all rows and columns once,\

    P2.12. Max flow in a square\nInput: \n    grid: an m x n matrix, each entry is\
    \ an integer in the range [-1000000, 1000000].\nOutput: \n    an integer denoting\
    \ the max flow in the grid.\nThe first row and first column are filled with 0s.\n\
    The rest of the grid is unchanged.\nEach row and column has exactly one 1 cell,\
    \ which means the flow in the cell is 0.\nThe flow (maximum flow of 1 cell) starts\
    \ from the top left cell and goes to the bottom right cell.\nThe flow of a cell\
    \ is equal to the sum of the flows in the two cells above, to the left and to\
    \ the below it.\nThe flow is 0 if the cell is empty.\nExample 1:\n\n[[0, 0, 0],\n\
    \ [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe flow goes from cell\
    \ [0, 0] to [0, 1] because the sum of the flows from [0, 0] to [0, 1] is 0.\n\
    The flow goes from cell [0, 0] to [1, 1] because the sum of the flows from [0,\
    \ 0] to [1, 1] is 1.\nThe flow goes from cell [0, 1] to [0, 2] because the sum\
    \ of the flows from [0, 1] to [0, 2] is 0.\nThe flow goes from cell [0, 1] to\
    \ [1, 2] because the sum of the flows from [0, 1] to [1, 2] is 0.\nThe flow goes\
    \ from cell [1, 1] to [0, 0] because the sum of the flows from [1, 1] to [0, 0]\
    \ is 0.\nThe flow goes from cell [1, 1] to [1, 1] because the sum of the flows\
    \ from [1, 1] to [1, 1] is 1.\nThe flow goes from cell [1, 1] to [0, 1] because\
    \ the sum of the flows from [1, 1] to [0, 1] is 0.\nThe flow goes from cell [1,\
    \ 1] to [0, 2] because the sum of the flows from [1, 1] to [0, 2] is 0.\nThe flow\
    \ goes from cell [1, 1] to [1, 2] because the sum of the flows from [1, 1] to\
    \ [1, 2] is 1.\nThe flow goes from cell [1, 2] to [0, 0] because the sum of the\

    \ the wells that don't need to be filled. As per my example in the question, both\
    \ grids and expected outputs have equal number of elements. Also, the output is\
    \ not correct in the second example. Your code is incorrect. Check it out yourself.\n\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe expected output should be 1 for the first example and 2\
    \ for the second example because all wells need to be filled, but not all wells\
    \ need to be empty. If you see the expected output in the second example, we can\
    \ see that the first column of grid does not need any change as they all have\
    \ capacity 1. The remaining columns in the second example need to count as one\
    \ because all wells need to be filled.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI updated the code\
    \ above. I am not able to test it right now, but I hope it helps.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nIt works now. Thanks for your help! Although I wasn't able to make it\
