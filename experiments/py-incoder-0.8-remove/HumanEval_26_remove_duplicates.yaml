    \ is very similar to lists in that they both contain an ordered collection of\
    \ objects. You create them by putting comma-separated values inside of the parentheses\
    \ ( ). The values can be of any type, but they will all be treated as strings.\n\
    \nTuples are created with the syntax \"(type1, type2, ...)\" where each type is\
    \ separated from the next by commas. Let's look at some examples:\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <cell>\nt = (3, 4.5, 6, 7.5)\nprint(t)\n</cell>\n<cell>\nt = ('hello', 2.3, 'world')\n\
    print(t)\n</cell>\n<cell>\nt = (1, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5])\nprint(t)\n</cell>\n<cell>\n\
    t = (1, ['a', 'b', 'c'], [4.5])\nprint(t)\n</cell>\n<text>\nAs with lists, there\
    \ are some important differences between tuples and lists. Tuples are created\
    \ with parentheses instead of curly brackets, and you can select an individual\
    \ element by specifying its index:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nt = (1, [1, 2, 3], [4,\
    \ 5])\nprint(t[0])\n</cell>\n<text>\nUnlike lists, tuples can have functions as\
    \ values just like lists can:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nt = (1, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5])\n\
    print(t[1][2])\n</cell>\n<text>\nYou can unpack a tuple into separate variables:\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<cell>\na, b, c = t\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\nprint(c)\n</cell>\n<text>\n\
    The commas separating the values form the tuple, and the parentheses form the\
    \ tuple.\n\nThe main difference between tuples and lists is the fact that tuples\
    \ are immutable, while lists are mutable.\n\nOnce you have a tuple you can never\
    \ change it or convert it into a list. You can only create a new tuple using new\
    \ values that you already have in memory. The commas separate different tuples\
    \ while parentheses separate different tuples from each other.\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <cell>\nt = (1, 'a', 'b')\nt[0] = 5\n</cell>\n<cell>\nt[0] = 'd'\n</cell>\n<text>\n\
    Sets\nA set is an unordered collection of objects. You create them with the set\
    \ keyword.\n\nThe syntax for a set is \"{values}\" where \"values\" is any number\
    \ of values, separated by commas, and curly brackets are used to indicate a tuple:",

    \ reason your original code doesn't work is that the numbers in `input_numbers`\

    \ sort them in place. Once you modify a list, Python will garbage collect the\
    \ old list as soon as you've finished with it, so you lose the reference to the\
    \ original numbers. If you modify `input_numbers` after calling `remove_duplicates`,\
    \ you're not modifying the list that you're passing into `remove_duplicates`,\
    \ you're modifying something else that has a reference to `numbers`.\n<|/ c |>\n\

    \ the Python standard library as part of Python's collections.\nHowever, for educational\
    \ purposes, to write our own functions, we can use some of Python's builtins first!\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<text>\nDictionaries\nDictionaries are a more advanced data structure,\
    \ and can be thought of as a list of key-value pairs.\nA dictionary consists of\
    \ a set of keys and a set of values, and can be created via a pair of curly brackets\
    \ ({}).\nEach pair is separated by a comma, and each key is separated from its\
    \ value by a colon.\nThe colons also serve as delimiting the keys and the values.\n\
    The commas must all be on the same line or the string won't compile!\nFor example,\
    \ the following dictionary consists of the strings hello, world, and foo:\n\n\
    {\n    'hello': 'world',\n    'foo': 'bar'\n}\nWe can access each item in the\
    \ dictionary via the keys, and we can use the values to find things in the dictionary.\n\
    \nTo add a new item to the dictionary, we simply append a new key-value pair to\
    \ the dictionary.\nThe syntax for adding a new key-value pair is as follows:\n\
    \nnew_dictionary[key] = value\nWe append the new value after the current value\
    \ using the following syntax:\n\nnew_dictionary[key] = value\nThis looks weird\
    \ at first, because it's really just adding an extra key-value pair.\nWhy is that?\
    \ We'll come back to it later.\nIn fact, the key is only used to identify the\
    \ value!\nWe'll come back to that in a bit!\n\nThe value of each key is usually\
    \ a list, though.\nLists store multiple pieces of information together.\nThis\
    \ is usually the most common data structure you'll see in Python code, so we'll\
    \ focus on lists.\nYou can think of a list as a group of things all of which are\
    \ related.\nFor example, we can create a list by adding things together!\nTo do\
    \ this, we can use the built-in function list.append() with the following syntax:\n\
    \nlist.append(new_thing)\nLet's see an example of this:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\n\
    list_of_things = [1, 'a', 2, 'b']\nprint(list_of_things)\n</cell>\n<cell>\nlist_of_things.append(3)\n\
    print(list_of_things)\n</cell>\n<text>\nNote the difference!\nIn the first case,\
    \ list_of_things still contains a single value, the integer 1.\nIn the second\
    \ case, list_of_things now contains a value which is a list containing an integer\
    \ 1, an alphabetical character a, a second integer 2, and another alphabetical\
    \ character b.\nIf you try to combine two lists with +, ", "    \n    \n    sorted_numbers\
