    \ for the answer. I understand why it didn't work, but didn't think it was a good\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n- That is one way to do it, but then you cannot pass `y` back\
    \ into the function.  But if the function is going to modify `y`, then it must\
    \ return a new value.  It can't return a reference to `y`.  So you need to do\

    <| c |>\nOkay, that makes sense. Thank you.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nThe short\
    \ answer is that you can't, because it's an immutable object. The longer answer\
    \ is that you can use a mutable object like a list as a return value, but it won't\
    \ be threadsafe. A list is a list of objects, so the list can't be mutated when\
    \ you're using it as a return value because it's an immutable object.\n<|/ a tags=python,mutable\

    \ have a space between it and the number, so Python doesn't treat the number 29\
    \ as a string but rather as a number.\n\nPython is a strongly typed language.\
    \  This means that the types of variables are fixed at the time you write the\

    \ package to be used and imported.\n\nTo create a package, just create a directory\
    \ and name it with the name of the package, without the .py extension. For instance:\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<cell>\nmy_package\n</cell>\n<text>\nTo use a package, import the\
