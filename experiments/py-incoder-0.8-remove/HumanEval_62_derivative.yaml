    \ is correct, however, I would also recommend looking into list comprehensions.\
    \  This allows you to make simple for loops and do some more complex stuff (ie,\
    \ create lists).\nThe main advantage of list comprehensions is that they can be\
    \ nested for loops and can even be used within other list comprehensions.  \n\
    One example would be something like:\n<code>\n[[x**2 for x in a if a % 2 == 0]\
    \ for a in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]]\n</code>\nThe above code will return:\n<code>\n\
    [[2, 4], [4, 8], [8, 16], [16, 32], [32, 64], [64, 128], [128, 256]]\n</code>\n\

    \ comprehensions, I highly recommend reading this article.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Thank you for the feedback. Sadly, I was hoping to get a more \"general\" example\

    \ use? At each iteration, you will increase the value of $a_n$ and solve the equation\n\
    \\begin{align}\na_n &= x_n - x_0 \\\n\\end{align}\nby substituting $x_n$ with\
    \ $x_{n+1}$ and solve it until you reach the value of $x_n$. \nRepeat this process\

    \ that calculates approximated derivatives and returns them as a list of approximations.\n\

    \ the following equation $f(x) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and you have to calculate\
    \ its derivative $f'(x)$, you should find $f'(x)$ by solving the equation $\\\
    frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$. \nTherefore, your approximate_derivative()\
    \ function should solve the equation $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{x^2\
    \ + 1}}$ and return $\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ as the approximation of $f'(x)$.\
    \ \nIn case you cannot solve the equation $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{x^2\
    \ + 1}}$, the function should raise an exception telling the user that such approximation\
    \ does not exist.\n\nDo not use while loops, for loops, recursion or any other\
    \ methods to solve the derivative, use recursion to solve this problem.\n\nFor\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI'm going to have to rethink this solution, because I'm not too\
    \ sure I understand the logic of it. I know that I can just append `xs[0]` onto\
    \ the list `results` once I find the `k` highest-order coefficients. So wouldn't\
    \ it be better to do that then append the highest order coefficients, instead\
    \ of finding the `k` highest-order coefficients first?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe\
    \ logic of finding the K highest order coefficients is to append the Kth coefficient\
    \ of x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5 and x^6, and then multiply them by x (to find\
    \ the Kth power), and then multiply them by x^1, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6 and so\
    \ on until you reach the end. \n\nIt would take time O(n) in the worst case, where\
    \ n = len(xs). If you have many polynomials of increasing degree, you can speed\
    \ up the process by using a more optimized algorithm to find the k highest order\
    \ coefficients. Such a more optimized algorithm is called Kth order polynomial\
