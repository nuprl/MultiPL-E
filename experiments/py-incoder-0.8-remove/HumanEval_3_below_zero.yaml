    I dont think this is a very good approach as it would take O(n*m) time whereas\
    \ there are only 2 operations to be performed here.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHow about\
    \ if we have another list of operations where each operation is an operation on\
    \ a list and there is only 1 operation to be performed like `[-1,-1,-1]` , here\
    \ -1 means subtraction operation and +1 means addition operation. I am wondering\
    \ if we could do this in linear time?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis approach is very\
    \ bad as it requires O(n*m) time whereas in case of two operations the time complexity\

    \ time by iterating through each element in the list to find the first negative\
