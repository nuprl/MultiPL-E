prompt: "-- I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\
  -- event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n\
  -- definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n-- Your task is to determine if\
  \ a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n-- You are given\
  \ two tables of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match.\
  \ \n-- Return a table of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If\
  \ they have guessed correctly,\n-- the value is 0, and if not, the value is the\
  \ absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n-- example:\n-- >>> compare({1,\
  \ 2, 3, 4, 5, 1}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2})\n-- {0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3}\n-- >>> compare({0,\
  \ 5, 0, 0, 0, 4}, {4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2})\n-- {4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6}\nlocal function compare(game,\
