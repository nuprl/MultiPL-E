prompt: "//I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\

  // definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n// Your task is to determine if\
  \ a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n// You are given\
  \ two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match.\
  \ \n// Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If\
  \ they have guessed correctly,\n// the value is 0, and if not, the value is the\
  \ absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n// example:\n// >>> compare([1,\
  \ 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2])\n// [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n// >>> compare([0,\
