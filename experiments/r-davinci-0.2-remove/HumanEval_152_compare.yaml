prompt: "# I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\
  # event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n\
  # definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n# Your task is to determine if a\

  \ \n# Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If\
  \ they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute\
  \ difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\ncompare <- function(game,\
