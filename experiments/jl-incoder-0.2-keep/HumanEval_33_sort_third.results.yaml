    \ I noticed that and fixed it\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe answer by is correct but\
    \ can be improved. \nThe first thing that comes to mind is that it sorts the list\
    \ twice (once in the first line and once in the second line). \nThe second thing\
    \ is that it sorts the list three times (once in the first line and once in the\
    \ second line and once in the third line). \nThe third thing is that it sorts\
    \ the list four times (once in the first line and once in the second line and\
    \ once in the third line and once in the fourth line).\nThe fourth thing is that\
    \ it sorts the list five times (once in the first line and once in the second\
    \ line and once in the third line and once in the fourth line and once in the\
    \ fifth line).\nThe fifth thing is that it sorts the list six times (once in the\
    \ first line and once in the second line and once in the third line and once in\
    \ the fourth line and once in the fifth line and once in the sixth line).\nThe\
    \ sixth thing is that it sorts the list seven times (once in the first line and\
    \ once in the second line and once in the third line and once in the fourth line\
    \ and once in the fifth line and once in the sixth line and once in the seventh\
    \ line).\nThe seventh thing is that it sorts the list eight times (once in the\
    \ first line and once in the second line and once in the third line and once in\
    \ the fourth line and once in the fifth line and once in the sixth line and once\
    \ in the seventh line and once in the eighth line).\nThe eighth thing is that\
    \ it sorts the list nine times (once in the first line and once in the second\
    \ line and once in the third line and once in the fourth line and once in the\
    \ fifth line and once in the sixth line and once in the seventh line and once\
    \ in the eighth line and once in the ninth line).\nThe ninth thing is that it\
    \ sorts the list ten times (once in the first line and once in the second line\
