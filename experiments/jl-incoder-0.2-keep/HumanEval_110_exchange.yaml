    Problem 3\nWrite a function that takes two vectors of numbers, and determines\
    \ whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\nbetween them to make\
    \ lst1 a list of only even numbers.\nThere is no limit on the number of exchanged\
    \ elements between lst1 and lst2.\nIf it is possible to exchange elements between\
    \ the lst1 and lst2 to make\nall the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\"\
    .\nOtherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])\
    \ => \"YES\"\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\nIt is assumed that\
    \ the input lists will be non-empty.\nHint: You can use the function exchange.\n\
    Hint: You can use the function length.", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\
