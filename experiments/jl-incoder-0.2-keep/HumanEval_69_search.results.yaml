    <text>\nPart III. Searching in a Sorted Array\nA binary search is similar to searching\
    \ in a sorted array, but instead of searching for a specific value, it searches\
    \ for a specific index. \nThe binary search is also called a binary search because\
    \ it is based on the idea of dividing the array into two halves, \none half containing\
    \ the smaller elements and the other half containing the larger elements. \nThe\
    \ search is then done on the smaller half of the array. \nThe binary search is\
    \ guaranteed to terminate when the element is not present in the array. \nThe\
    \ binary search is guaranteed to be logarithmic when the array is sorted.\nusing\
