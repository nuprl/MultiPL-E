prompt: "<?php\n// We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n\
  // numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if\n\
  // it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing \n\
  // the following operation on the given array:\n// You are allowed to perform right\
  \ shift operation any number of times.\n// One right shift operation means shifting\
  \ all elements of the array by one\n// position in the right direction. The last\
  \ element of the array will be moved to\n// the starting position in the array i.e.\
  \ 0th index. \n// If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the\
  \ above operation\n// then return True else return False.\n// If the given array\
  \ is empty then return True.\n// Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique\
  \ elements.\n// For Example:\n// >>> move_one_ball(array(3, 4, 5, 1, 2))\n// true\n\
  // Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n\
  // be achieved for the given array.\n// >>> move_one_ball(array(3, 5, 4, 1, 2))\n\
  // false\n// Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the\
