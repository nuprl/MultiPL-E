    <| c |>\nI like your solution, but I believe it can be simplified a bit. `array_filter`\
    \ can take an anonymous function as an argument, so you can just do `array_filter($lst,\
    \ function($num) { return $num > 0; })` instead of `array_filter($lst, function($num)\
    \ { return $num > 0; })`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks, I didn't know that. I've\
