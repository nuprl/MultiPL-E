prompt: "# You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute\
  \ the\n# average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). \n# Round\
  \ the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.\n# If n is greater\
  \ than m, return -1.\n# Example:\n# rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n# rounded_avg(7,\
  \ 5) => -1\n# rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n# rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\
