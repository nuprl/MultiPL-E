    \ line algorithm here.  In particular, we sort the cars based on their\n  # starting\
    \ positions:  cars that start out at a higher left-most position come before cars\n\
    \  # that start at a lower left-most position.  We sweep from left to right. \
    \ At any point in\n  # time, we maintain the following invariant:  the cars to\
    \ the left of our line are all moving\n  # left to right, and the cars to the\
    \ right of our line are all moving right to left.  As we sweep\n  # from left\
    \ to right, any car that we hit needs to move from the left to the right.  In\
    \ other words,\n  # we need to move it over the line.  This is equivalent to saying\
    \ that we need to invert the\n  # direction of that car.  Suppose that we have\
    \ already moved over all cars to the left of our line,\n  # and then we move over\
    \ a car that's currently to the right of our line.  Since the car is already to\n\
    \  # the right of our line, its direction is already correct.  It is moving right\
    \ to left.  Thus, we don't\n  # need to invert its direction.  So, the only time\
    \ we need to invert a car's direction is when the car\n  # is to the left of our\
    \ line.  Thus, we only need to invert the directions of cars to the left of our\n\
    \  # line.  This can be thought of as a \"merge\" operation, where the \"merge\"\
    \ is defined as follows:\n  #\n  # (1) From the left to the right, find the first\
    \ car that's moving right to left.  Let's call that car\n  # x.  Find the first\
    \ car to the right of x that's moving left to right.  Let's call that car y.\n\
    \  # (2) Invert the directions of all cars from x to y, inclusive.\n  # (3) Repeat\
    \ (1) and (2) until we reach the end of the line.\n  #\n  # The number of inversions\
    \ is precisely the number of collisions.  This is because the number of collisions\n\
    \  # is precisely the number of times that the cars change their direction.\n\
    \  #\n  # Our sweep line algorithm is identical to the above merge algorithm,\
    \ except that we sort\nrequire 'test/unit'\nclass TestHumanEval < Test::Unit::TestCase\n\
