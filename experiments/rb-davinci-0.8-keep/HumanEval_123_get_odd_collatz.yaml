prompt: "# Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers\
  \ in collatz sequence.\n# The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics\
  \ that concerns a sequence defined\n# as follows: start with any positive integer\
  \ n. Then each term is obtained from the \n# previous term as follows: if the previous\
  \ term is even, the next term is one half of \n# the previous term. If the previous\
  \ term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n# term plus 1. The conjecture\
  \ is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n# Note:\
  \ \n# 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n# 2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n# For\
  \ example:\n# get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is\
  \ [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\ndef get_odd_collatz(n)\n"
