prompt: "# Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra\
  \ operations, and \n# the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists\
  \ to build the algebric \n# expression and return the evaluation of this expression.\n\
  # The basic algebra operations:\n# Addition ( + ) \n# Subtraction ( - ) \n# Multiplication\
  \ ( * ) \n# Floor division ( // ) \n# Exponentiation ( ** ) \n# Example:\n# operator['+',\
  \ '*', '-']\n# array = [2, 3, 4, 5]\n# result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n# => result = 9\n\
  # Note:\n# The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus\
  \ one.\n# Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.\n# Operator list has at\
  \ least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.\ndef do_algebra(operator,\
