    \ are several errors in your code (most of them have been already pointed out).\n\
    The first one is that the return statement should have a type. For example, the\
    \ following is incorrect:\n<code>\nreturn new long[] {carrots, leftover};\n</code>\n\
    It should be:\n<code>\nreturn new long[] {carrots, leftover}; // notice the semicolon\n\
    </code>\nThe second one is that you never initialized carrots and leftover. You\
    \ should do something like this:\n<code>\nlong carrots = number-remaining;\nlong\
    \ leftover = remaining;\n</code>\nThe third problem is that you use the variable\
    \ leftover twice in one function:\n<code>\nlong leftover = remaining;\n...\ncarrots\
    \ = number-remaining;\nleftover = remaining; // You use here the variable that\
    \ is local to the function.\n</code>\nThis results in that you are using it once\
    \ too often. You can rename one of the variables to avoid this confusion like\
    \ this:\n<code>\nlong carrots = number-remaining;\nlong remainingCarrots = remaining;\n\
    ...\ncarrots = number-remaining;\nremainingCarrots = remaining;\n</code>\n<|/\

    \ |>\n<| a tags=algorithm,big-o dscore=1 |>\nThe first thing that I would change\
    \ about your code would be to return an array instead of using longs. This will\
    \ make your function easier to read, since you would not have to deal with the\
    \ complications of casting between long and int.\nYour second thing would be to\
    \ use the mod operator in your test. This will simplify your algorithm.\n<code>\n\
    long[] eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n    int counter = 0;\n \
    \   int counter2 = 0;\n    long result = 0;\n    \n    while(counter < need &&\
    \ counter2 < remaining) {\n        if (number >= 0) counter = counter + number;\n\
    \        else counter = counter - number;\n        number = number % remaining;\n\
    \        counter2 = counter2+1;\n    }\n    \n    while(counter > 0 && counter2\
    \ < remaining) {\n        counter = counter - 1;\n        number = number - 1;\n\

    \ your solution is not working, as I believe the mod operator only works on integers.\n\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks. I like the way you did the return statement. I will implement\
    \ this. However, why did you choose the second option with the array?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nIn most cases the second method will be much more performant than the\
    \ first. If I recall correctly the compiler will eliminate unnecessary memory\
    \ allocations when returning arrays. However I may be wrong.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I implemented this and it works. I tested it against the code in the original\
    \ question and also against the code in the question. My solution is more performant\
    \ than the original code in both cases. Could you please explain why your solution\
    \ is more performant than the original code? Also, is there a way to make it more\
    \ concise?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIn your solution the compiler will allocate a temporary\
    \ array for each call which causes a lot of overhead for large arrays. I thought\
    \ that using the second method would be more performant since you avoid the extra\
    \ memory allocations. However I may be wrong since I don't have the C compiler\
    \ at hand.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Your solution would also work if you added the\
    \ line `long temp = eat(number, need, remaining);` before your return statement.\
    \ Since your solution returns an array, this line could potentially save some\
    \ memory. However if you did this the compiler would not be able to optimize away\
    \ the temporary array so your solution would be preferable. Also I wouldn't recommend\
    \ using double instead of int unless you really need the extra precision, there\
    \ are better ways of representing integers.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=c,algorithm dscore=0\

    \ you want the amount of carrots eaten to be the difference between them and the\
    \ amount of carrots left in stock. Why don't you just subtract that value from\
    \ the number of carrots left?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes this makes sense to me,\

    \ programming. Any advice or help is really appreciated.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=java,arrays,algorithm,functional-programming\
    \ |>\nThe code below is the solution for the example you gave, and it uses both\
    \ recursion and iteration. It uses a combination of recursion and iteration in\
    \ the order of the code example. The iteration section starts at line 164 on the\
    \ bottom, and the recursion section starts at line 159.\n<code>\npublic class\

    \ things, I admit. Although the code I posted is very simple and could be adapted\
    \ to his problem, I wanted to show that his solution was quite elegant and he\
    \ was able to understand it by thinking about the problem and the solution in\
    \ one go. Hope that helps!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHaving said that, I agree with\

    \ Programming here. \nThis approach involves remembering the previous day's number\
    \ of eaten carrots, and the number of carrots left. Initially, both are zero.\
    \ \nThe algorithm will update these variables whenever the previous day's number\
    \ of eaten carrots becomes greater than or equal to the number of carrots left.\
    \ \nSince the number of carrots left will always be less than the total carrots\
    \ left in the previous day, the last update can be computed by the difference\
    \ between the two: \n\nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate = eat;\n\n    assert(candidate(5L,\

    <|/ a tags=c++,algorithm,dynamic-programming dscore=3 |>\n<| c |>\nThis is a fantastic\
    \ answer! I really like the explanation and the pseudo code. I appreciate the\
    \ effort you put into your answer :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=c++,algorithm,dynamic-programming\
    \ dscore=2 |>\nOne naive approach would be to start with \"all meals consumed\
    \ so far\" as [0, 0], and \"eating\" carrot as 1, and adding them up.\nFor each\
    \ day, add 1 to meal consumed so far, and subtract 1 from carrot consumed so far,\
    \ until either meal is at 0 or carrot is at 0. Then the sum of the two numbers\
    \ is equal to the \"eating\" carrots.\nThis algorithm does not consider whether\
    \ you can still eat another carrot if the meal is at 0 or if the carrot is at\
    \ 0, but you can easily add a conditional statement to account for that if needed.\n\
    <|/ a |>\n<| a tags=c++,algorithm,dynamic-programming dscore=2 |>\nIn an extension\
    \ of Jason S's solution from above, you can implement this as an iterative algorithm.\
    \ The basic idea is that you keep a list of what you've eaten and how much you've\
    \ eaten (so basically an array with two elements [consumed carrots, carrots-eaten]).\
    \ If you have a meal that you've eaten, you increase the eaten counter and remove\
    \ one from the consumed counter.\nThe algorithm is recursive. In the end, you\
    \ go through your eating list and add up the two numbers up.\nThis is how I would\
    \ implement it.\n<code>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <list>\nunittest\n{\n \

    \ that makes sense and is easily modifiable to handle any number of meals. You\

    I like how you use variable names like `c`, `m`, and `r`. But I do not believe\
    \ it really adds anything; it just makes the code more difficult to read. Also,\
    \ I don't think this is correct because the problem requires me to return an array\
    \ of length 2 where the array element 0 contains the number of meals remaining\
    \ and the array element 1 contains the number of carrots left in the meal to be\
    \ eaten. Your code returns an array where the array element 0 contains the number\
    \ of carrots left in the meal to be eaten and the array element 1 contains the\
    \ number of carrots left in the remaining meals.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh, I didn't\
    \ read the question correctly. I think the problem could be solved with [dynamic\
    \ programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming). I'll think\
    \ about this more... :-)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay, I've been thinking about it\
    \ this morning and I believe dynamic programming is indeed the way to go. I can't\
    \ really solve this problem efficiently without doing some sort of recurrence\
    \ because there isn't a fixed bound for the number of meals to be eaten so I need\
    \ to do some kind of memoization or memoize it. But I think this is the right\
    \ approach. I'll post my final solution if I figure out how to do that.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI've added a more efficient solution based on the same idea. You\
    \ should be able to adapt it to your problem pretty easily.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1\
    \ tags=dynamic-programming,math,combinatorics,java,algorithm |>\nMy answer might\
    \ not be applicable to the actual problem you were trying to solve, but I thought\
    \ I'd share it anyways. I'm leaving the original answer here because I think it\
    \ still has some merit.\nI thought that there might be a way to solve this problem\
    \ with dynamic programming, but I haven't found it yet.\nThe idea is that we can\
