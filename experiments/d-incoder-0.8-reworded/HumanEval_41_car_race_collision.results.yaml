    \ c |>\n<| a tags=math,geometry,algorithm,computational-geometry |>\nI recently\
    \ stumbled upon this problem and it turns out that this problem is a simple version\
    \ of the knapsack problem.\nThe knapsack problem is NP-complete as stated in the\
    \ Wikipedia page, but this problem has many applications. One example is the travelling\
    \ salesman problem (TSP). However, there are many other problems where this property\
    \ is true, such as race car collision.\nThis problem is actually quite intuitive\
    \ and simple.\nImagine an infinite line, with N stations. In a perfect world,\
    \ all the cars will collide. However, in a real world they don't. Think of a car\
    \ driving left and right in the same time. You would expect them to collide.\n\
    So the solution would be to calculate the minimum distance between the two lines\
    \ of stations. \n<code>\nLet L=the line with the fewest stations.\nLet D=the line\
    \ with the fewest stations.\nLet D1=the line with the fewest stations.\nLet D2=the\
    \ line with the fewest stations.\n</code>\nNow, calculate the distance between\
    \ each pair of stations.\n<code>\nD1=sqrt((L1.x - L2.x)^2 + (L1.y - L2.y)^2)\n\
    D2=sqrt((L3.x - L4.x)^2 + (L3.y - L4.y)^2)\n</code>\nCalculate the distance from\
    \ L to D1 as well.\n\nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate = car_race_collision;\n\

    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nNice solution. Unfortunately it is exponential time complexity.\
    \ And doesn't provide the same result as Cartesian product.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=combinatorics,algorithm\
    \ |>\nThe first thing to notice is that a collision is when one car collides with\
    \ two cars that are not directly next to each other. So, you can calculate the\
    \ number of collisions for a car only by checking how many other cars can collide\
    \ with it. So we can just use a hash table to store the collisions. \nNow, since\
    \ collision count for any car is equal to the number of collisions for any car\
    \ that passes through a car that collides with it, so we can easily calculate\
    \ the collision count for any car.\nFor each collision we could just update the\
    \ collision count in the hash table. So, we can calculate the collision count\
    \ for any car as follows (here I assume that all cars pass through each other):\n\
    <code>\ncollision count = (number of collisions for cars passing through this\
    \ car)\n</code>\nThe collision count for any car will be equal to the number of\
    \ collisions whose first car collides with any other car (since there is only\
    \ one collision, we can just ignore them here). Then, for each other car that\
    \ collides with this car we increase the collision \nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate\

    \ about algorithmic efficiency, and I believe that this algorithm performs well\
    \ enough in real life situations because it's based on a standard geometric means\
    \ of calculating geometric means and distance between two points.  It also avoids\
    \ the nasty math involved in checking intersections with infinite lines.  It also\
    \ doesn't have the problem of repeated collisions between different cars on the\
    \ same track.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHe also asked specifically about algorithmic\
    \ efficiency and for efficiency in real life. Obviously I do not have that knowledge\
    \ on the OP's side :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I realised that after posting.\
    \ I was just commenting on the answer, which I thought was useful. :) Still, I\
    \ think that this is still useful.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=intersection,point,math,algorithm\
    \ |>\nIn terms of real life implementations, you could create a spatial index\
    \ (a k-d tree) over your points. Then, when you need to find all the cars that\
    \ collide, you can simply query the k-d tree to find all cars within a certain\
    \ distance.\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| a tags=intersection,point,math,algorithm dscore=2\
    \ |>\nI did this once. Instead of just checking if two lines intersected, I used\
    \ the following approach: I created one segment between each pair of points, and\
    \ I calculated the normal vector for each segment. I then calculated the distance\
    \ of each point to each other point in the same direction as the normals. These\
    \ distances were used to determine which segments intersected.\n\nunittest\n{\n\

    \ tags=collision-detection,c,algorithm,c++,collision |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the\
    \ answer. But can you elaborate more on how you would implement this in C++? Specifically\
    \ how I would write the car_collide function?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I've added\
    \ a C++ implementation to the answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nVery thorough, thorough\
    \ explanation, very well done.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHi, how can i implement this\
    \ in Java?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt would be more of a workaround to implement the\
    \ same algorithm in Java using classes with getters and setters, instead of having\
    \ a public variable which can be modified from outside the class.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a |>\nI believe it's called a race car collision, where one car can't drive\
    \ against the other.\nThe general problem is that there are infinitely many possible\
    \ cars within a certain distance. Even if every car had a finite number of possible\
    \ collisions, you would still have to solve for a subset of the possible collisions\
    \ to find out which ones actually happened. And this subset is not the set that\
