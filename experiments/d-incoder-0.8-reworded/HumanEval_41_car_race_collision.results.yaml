    \ c |>\n<| a tags=math,geometry,algorithm,computational-geometry |>\nI recently\
    \ stumbled upon this problem and it turns out that this problem is a simple version\
    \ of the knapsack problem.\nThe knapsack problem is NP-complete as stated in the\
    \ Wikipedia page, but this problem has many applications. One example is the travelling\
    \ salesman problem (TSP). However, there are many other problems where this property\
    \ is true, such as race car collision.\nThis problem is actually quite intuitive\
    \ and simple.\nImagine an infinite line, with N stations. In a perfect world,\
    \ all the cars will collide. However, in a real world they don't. Think of a car\
    \ driving left and right in the same time. You would expect them to collide.\n\
    So the solution would be to calculate the minimum distance between the two lines\
    \ of stations. \n<code>\nLet L=the line with the fewest stations.\nLet D=the line\
    \ with the fewest stations.\nLet D1=the line with the fewest stations.\nLet D2=the\
    \ line with the fewest stations.\n</code>\nNow, calculate the distance between\
    \ each pair of stations.\n<code>\nD1=sqrt((L1.x - L2.x)^2 + (L1.y - L2.y)^2)\n\
    D2=sqrt((L3.x - L4.x)^2 + (L3.y - L4.y)^2)\n</code>\nCalculate the distance from\
    \ L to D1 as well.\n\nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate = car_race_collision;\n\

    Thank you for answering. Unfortunately, my solution does not run for large numbers\

    \ then the collision has happened; otherwise, no collision has happened.\" In\
    \ this case, the collision is \"If `right` is less than `1` and the cars *do not\

    \ got it. Thanks a lot.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=c,arrays,c++,algorithm |>\nIf your\

    \ each time you find a collision you increase a counter and decrease the index\
    \ by 1.\nA simpler method is to use a counter variable and loop from 0 to n-1.\
    \ The inner loop can keep track of the number of collisions so far. Once the inner\
    \ loop has finished you know how many collisions there are. If you're unfamiliar\
    \ with recursion, the following is a loop implementation:\n<code>\nunittest\n\

    \ |>\nThe answer is actually quite simple, but unfortunately I am not familiar\
    \ with the language to code it in for you :-) The solution involves some basic\
    \ concepts that will definitely help you understand how the code works. \nLet\
    \ us start with the basic idea, which is that we want to be able to compare each\
    \ pair of cars according to their position and speed. \nSo, we will need a way\
    \ to compare cars, for which we can use its position and speed. \nWe can create\
    \ a simple struct that holds position and speed, like this:\n<code>\nstruct Car\n\
    {\n    Vector2 position;\n    double speed;\n};\n</code>\nThen we can make an\
    \ std::vector<Car> of all the cars, and a vector<pair<int, int>>, that contains\
    \ pairs of indices (index1 and index2) of all the cars, in their original order:\n\
    <code>\nstd::vector<Car> cars; // all the cars\nstd::vector<pair<int, int>> collisions;\
    \ // the indices of all the cars that collide\n</code>\nNow, the next step is\
    \ to implement a function that compares two cars, for which we can use the previously\
    \ created structures\nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate = car_race_collision;\n\

    \ |>\nThe first thing to notice is that a collision is when one car collides with\
    \ two cars that are not directly next to each other. So, you can calculate the\
    \ number of collisions for a car only by checking how many other cars can collide\
    \ with it. So we can just use a hash table to store the collisions. \nNow, since\
    \ collision count for any car is equal to the number of collisions for any car\
    \ that passes through a car that collides with it, so we can easily calculate\
    \ the collision count for any car.\nFor each collision we could just update the\
    \ collision count in the hash table. So, we can calculate the collision count\
    \ for any car as follows (here I assume that all cars pass through each other):\n\
    <code>\ncollision count = (number of collisions for cars passing through this\
    \ car)\n</code>\nThe collision count for any car will be equal to the number of\
    \ collisions whose first car collides with any other car (since there is only\
    \ one collision, we can just ignore them here). Then, for each other car that\
    \ collides with this car we increase the collision \nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate\

    \ I was just commenting on the answer, which I thought was useful. :) Still, I\
    \ think that this is still useful.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=intersection,point,math,algorithm\
    \ |>\nIn terms of real life implementations, you could create a spatial index\
    \ (a k-d tree) over your points. Then, when you need to find all the cars that\
    \ collide, you can simply query the k-d tree to find all cars within a certain\
    \ distance.\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| a tags=intersection,point,math,algorithm dscore=2\
    \ |>\nI did this once. Instead of just checking if two lines intersected, I used\
    \ the following approach: I created one segment between each pair of points, and\
    \ I calculated the normal vector for each segment. I then calculated the distance\
    \ of each point to each other point in the same direction as the normals. These\
    \ distances were used to determine which segments intersected.\n\nunittest\n{\n\

    \ answer. But can you elaborate more on how you would implement this in C++? Specifically\
    \ how I would write the car_collide function?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I've added\
    \ a C++ implementation to the answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nVery thorough, thorough\
    \ explanation, very well done.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHi, how can i implement this\
    \ in Java?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt would be more of a workaround to implement the\
    \ same algorithm in Java using classes with getters and setters, instead of having\
    \ a public variable which can be modified from outside the class.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a |>\nI believe it's called a race car collision, where one car can't drive\
    \ against the other.\nThe general problem is that there are infinitely many possible\
    \ cars within a certain distance. Even if every car had a finite number of possible\
    \ collisions, you would still have to solve for a subset of the possible collisions\
    \ to find out which ones actually happened. And this subset is not the set that\
    \ collides with any other car.\n<|/ a dscore=3 tags=collision-detection,c,algorithm,c++,collision\

    \ likely than not.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI believe it's called a race car collision,\
