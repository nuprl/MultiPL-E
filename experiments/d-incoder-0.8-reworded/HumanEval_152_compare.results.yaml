    \ the main method, with the main program code which calls the function compare.\
    \ The second part defines your compare method. This method will take two arrays\
    \ parameters. It will then create an empty array of the same length as the two\
    \ parameters and return it. The last part is the actual method, which is a recursive\
    \ method which keeps calling itself until it no longer finds a match. On each\
    \ call it will subtract the amount of guesses from either the score of the game\
    \ or the score of the guess. This will then be used to set the index where they\
    \ missed (as long as the two parameters are the same length). It will then check\
    \ whether the game and the guess are equal and move on. Otherwise, it checks which\
    \ index the game and guess are on (the one with the lower index value), then checks\
    \ whether they are equal. If they are equal, then the game and guess are equal,\
    \ so the difference between the scores is equal to the difference between the\
    \ length of the game and the length of the guess. The difference between the scores\
    \ is then added to the result array, and if it matches the length of the guess,\
    \ they have guessed correctly. The function will then be called recursively again\
    \ with different parameters. \nIn case you were wondering, why are we using recursion?\
    \ The method is not iterative, it is recursive. The function will simply call\
    \ itself over and over again until it finds a match, which in this case is when\
    \ the two arrays have a mismatch.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nHey, I like the idea of\
    \ using the return array instead of creating an extra variable. Thank you!\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\n, no problem! I didn't want to create any extra variables, I\
    \ just wanted to use recursion as a way to keep track of the guesses and scores.\
    \ If you're curious, I added a code example at the bottom of the answer, if you\
    \ have any more questions I can update my answer with some more explanation.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nTo make things easier, I added a method that will\
    \ tell you how many matches are found and how many are left after subtracting\
    \ the number of guesses from the scores. You only have to call this at the end\
    \ when all the scores have not changed.\nI also added a version that returns the\
    \ number of matches and the number of guesses left (this version is slightly less\
    \ efficient because it is calling itself twice)\n<code>\nstatic IE\nunittest\n\

    \ will notice that your original function only returns the same number of elements\
    \ as in input array, and your modified function returns array with additional\
    \ element that has how many correct guesses was made.\nLet's call the result array\
    \ from your modified function as array from modified.\nNow the question is how\
    \ to get only the part of array that has correct guesses. \nFirst thing you can\
    \ do is to just remove first element from array, since we know that first element\
    \ has correct guesses, because it is equal to number that appears in input array\
    \ as first element. Then you will get the array from modified. \n<code>\n    long[]\

    <| c |>\nWell, it's actually an assignment problem where you have to find how\
    \ far off each guess was from the correct game value. The `score` array is initialized\
    \ with zeroes. Since there is no way to tell the difference between a score of\
    \ zero and a score of 1, I initialize the `score` array with zeroes, and I compare\
    \ the guess to the correct game values by subtracting their absolute values from\
    \ the score. If the score is positive, the guess and game values are equal. If\
    \ negative, they are different. Does that make sense?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh wait.\

    The question asks you to compare the scores from the game against the guesses.\
    \ A score of 0 means a correct guess (i.e. the score is greater than or equal\
    \ to the correct guess) and a score of 1 means a wrong guess (i.e. the score is\
    \ less than or equal to the correct guess).\nFor each game game[i] you need to\
    \ find a guess for that game game[i]. This can be done by using a binary search\
    \ (aka binary search). Let the guesses be guesses[1..n] and games be games[1..n].\
    \ Let a guess be guess[i]. The binary search will find the correct guess for any\
    \ game in O(logn) time.\nSo the overall algorithm is something like\n<code>\n\
    guess = guess[1..n]\nguess = guess[1..n-1]\nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate =\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOP doesn't care about the order, they want an array, not an\

    \ what it's doing, except for the 'result[j]' part since I haven't got much experience\
    \ using Linq. Would you mind explaining it to me a little bit? Thanks!\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nSure thing. LINQ is a library (a collection of classes) that allows\
    \ you to quickly query collections for certain operations. In this case, it's\
    \ querying the array `game` for elements that differ from the array `guess`. Because\
    \ LINQ is querying the game, it's also querying `guess` too, and `result[j]` gets\
    \ the element at index `j` from the result of those two queries.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nThe second part is just checking if the guess is positive, and if so,\
    \ negating it. It's a common trick that works for `if` statements, but I'm not\
    \ sure it's the same for LINQ. `if` statements check a condition, and if it's\
    \ true, they continue with execution. LINQ queries the collection for elements\
    \ that match a condition, and only returns those elements. So this part of the\
    \ code simply negates the result of `game[i] - guess[i]`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Oh that makes sense! Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=arrays,math,c# |>\nI didn't\
    \ try to optimize this code but I think you can do it in an easier way using Linq\
    \ like this (I didn't test it but it should work)\n<code>\nlong[] result = game.Zip(guess.Select(x\
    \ => Math.Abs(x - y)), \n                          (x, y) => Math.Max(x, y)).ToArray();\n\
    </code>\nIt should create a result array that has all the differences between\
    \ the elements in the game array and the guesses array and if the difference is\
    \ bigger it will replace the one in the game array with the one in the guesses\
    \ array\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThank you very much for helping! I understand\
    \ it better and I understand what it's doing, except for the 'Math.Max' part \n\

    \ lowest to highest score and subtracting the difference of each scores score\
    \ from the corresponding guess. So if we have [1,1,5,3,5] for the scores and [1,1,5,5,4]\

    \ then the algorithm will return the scores as [1,1,-1,3,-1] (which is correct),\
    \ but it will actually return [1,1,5,3,-1]. So to fix that, you'll need to change\

    \ it returns an array of zeros, while if it is too low, it returns an array of\
    \ non-zeros, since there is no way to make a correct guess without getting a higher\
    \ score. Of course, if a guess is a perfect match, it will return an array of\
    \ ones. In any case, you can use the values as you wish.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0\

    <|/ a tags=sorting,algorithm,arrays |>\n<| c |>\nHi, can you explain why you chose\
    \ this solution?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis solution works perfectly, but it's only\
    \ good for a small number of matches. I've tried it on a few test cases (10 to\
    \ 100 matches) and it doesn't work with larger arrays even though it appears to\
    \ me it should.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe first part could be simplified to `int\
    \ totalGuesses = game.count{ game[i] == guess[i] };`. The second part could be\
    \ simplified to `int correct = game.count{ guess[i] == game[i] };`. The third\
    \ part could be simplified to `int result = game.count{ guess[i] == game[i] ?\
    \ 0 : (guess[i] - game[i]) };`. I don't think it's necessary to store the guesses\
    \ themselves in the array, but it's necessary to store the games they appeared\
    \ in (which may be useful for other parts of the program).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Yes, you are correct. I will edit that part into the original answer. Thanks.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=sorting,algorithm,arrays |>\nI think the problem is that your\
    \ algorithm is O(n^2) because you keep on re-sorting everything. \nYou should\
    \ try using a sorting algorithm that is O(nlogn) and then use a greedy algorithm\
    \ to find the optimal solution. \nEdit:\nYou can do this in O(n). See my answer\n\
    <|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThe OP has two arrays of scores, each one with n entries.\
    \ You don't need `n*logn` complexity for the sorting, only for the search (hence\
    \ the solution is in O(n)).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh \nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate\

    \ twice, but once with the \"scoreDiff\" array and once with the \"scoreGuess\"\
    \ array. From what I've read, that shouldn't matter. Or maybe it does, and I just\
    \ don't understand how you implemented it. I'll have to go back through your solution\
    \ a few times to try to understand what's going on. But, this has helped a lot,\
    \ thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=sorting,arrays,java |>\n<code>\nclass GameScore\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI guess I should add that this is in Java, and it seems like\
    \ I'm getting more confused about things now. I'll post a comment to that effect\
    \ if I can figure out what it means.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI've added the code I\
    \ used in my answer to your question. Hope it helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nAs stated\
    \ above, the question can be rephrased as \"how many pairwise subtractions should\
    \ I do to get the scores equal?\"  (This is probably a duplicate somewhere)\n\
    The approach I'd take would be to start with a score (X) which is as close to\
    \ the number of matching positions as possible.  If you found a match to both\
    \ positions, then subtract 2.  If there is a match to the first position, but\
    \ not to the second, subtract 1.  If there is a match to the second, but not to\
    \ the first, subtract 1.  Repeat until no more matches are possible.  This will\
    \ work better than going through every possible score and comparing it to every\
    \ other possible score.  In a very big score, this will be a lot of unnecessary\
    \ comparisons.\nEDIT: To show an example of this, the following code will give\
    \ you a score of 7 from the scores [4, 7, 8, 9] and [8, 4, 9, 7]:\n<code>\nvar\
    \ x = 4 - 8 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 +\
    \ 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4 + 7 - 9 + 8 - 4\n</code>\nIn C#\
    \ this would be:\n<code>\nunittest\n{\n    alias candidate = compare;\n\n    assert(candidate([1L,\

    \ answer the question, even though it solves the problem. The OP specifically\
    \ asked for a *functional* solution. Pure loops are usually a bad idea.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI guess the OP just want an idea and that's the answer here.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh, okay. I thought your question was more about how to implement\
    \ it, but it's nice to see someone else proposed an answer without actually trying\
    \ to solve the OP's problem. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis doesn't answer the question.\
    \ Also, your guess is wrong.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I agree, I'm just suggesting\
    \ a solution which might be useful.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=java,arrays |>\nI figured\
    \ out a way to do this in java. \nThe solution works by using a for loop and a\
    \ while loop.\nThe while loop is used to keep running until it finds a zero in\
    \ the guess and then it stops. It also stores the index of the zero into the variable\
    \ zeroIndex.\nThe for loop then starts at the index of the guess, and compares\
    \ it to the value in the game array.\n<code>\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nunittest\n\
