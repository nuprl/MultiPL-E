  \    // tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n    // tri(4) = 3\n    // tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1)\
  \ + tri(4)\n    // = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n    // You are given a non-negative integer\
  \ number n, you have to a return an array array list of the \n    // first n + 1\
  \ numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n    // Examples:\n    // >>> tri((3l))\n\
