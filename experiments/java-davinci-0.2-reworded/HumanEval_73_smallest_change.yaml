  class Problem {\n    // Given an array array list arr of integers, find the minimum\
  \ number of elements that\n    // need to be changed to make the array array list\
  \ palindromic. A palindromic array array list is an array array list that\n    //\
  \ is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element\
  \ to any other element.\n    // For example:\n    // >>> smallestChange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l,\
  \ (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)5l, (long)4l, (long)7l, (long)9l, (long)6l))))\n   \
  \ // (4l)\n    // >>> smallestChange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l,\
  \ (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l, (long)3l, (long)2l, (long)2l))))\n    // (1l)\n\
  \    // >>> smallestChange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l,\
  \ (long)3l, (long)2l, (long)1l))))\n    // (0l)\n    public static long smallestChange(ArrayList<Long>\
  \ arr) {\n"
