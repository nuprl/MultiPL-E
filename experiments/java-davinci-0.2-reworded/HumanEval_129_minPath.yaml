  class Problem {\n    // Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive\
  \ integer k, \n    // each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the\
  \ range [1, N * N]\n    // inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\
  \    // You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n\
  \    // from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n\
  \    // in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n\
  \    // cell.\n    // Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly\
  \ k cells (not\n    // necessarily distinct).\n    // You CANNOT go off the grid.\n\

  \    // after making the ordered array lists of the values on the cells that A and\
  \ B go\n    // through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically\
  \ less\n    // than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <=\
  \ i <= k)\n    // such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n\
