prompt: "//Given a positive integer n, return a sorted array that has the odd numbers\
  \ in collatz sequence.\n// The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics\
  \ that concerns a sequence defined\n// as follows: start with any positive integer\
  \ n. Then each term is obtained from the \n// previous term as follows: if the previous\
  \ term is even, the next term is one half of \n// the previous term. If the previous\
  \ term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n// term plus 1. The conjecture\
  \ is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n// Note:\
  \ \n// 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n// 2. returned array sorted in increasing order.\n\
  // For example:\n// get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for\
  \ 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n// >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n\
  // [1, 5]\nfunction get_odd_collatz(n: number): number[] {\n"
