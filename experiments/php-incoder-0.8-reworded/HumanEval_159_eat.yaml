    <| c |>\nYour solution is very close to mine. But it seems like the one where\
    \ you just remove the carrot from the stock but leave the stock unchanged. For\
    \ example you have 10 carrots, you need to eat 5 more carrots to complete the\
    \ day's meals. If you remove 3 from the stock, your total will be 11 instead of\
    \ 10. How do you solve the problem in this case? Thanks for you help though.\n\

    \ After the second iteration, the stock will become 4, and the first iteration\

    \ |>\nThe function you're looking for is called ceil(). It rounds to the nearest\
    \ whole number. If your number is greater than 100, it will be rounded to 100.\
    \ If it's less, it returns what it is. So you could use it like so:\n<code>\n\
    echo ceil(100 + $carrots);\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nHi, but I don't\
    \ want to round the number. I just want it to output the number I put in. For\
    \ example, if I put 5 carrots, I want to output the number 5\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Then you just want to cast it to an integer and echo it? `echo intval(ceil($carrots))`\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nTo find the number of carrots to eat, you can do the\
    \ following:\n<code>\n$carrots = 5;\n$carrots_needed = 10;\n$carrots_left = 100\
    \ - $carrots_needed;\n$carrots_to_eat = $carrots_left - $carrots;\n</code>\nIf\
    \ $carrots_to_eat is 5, you can eat 4 carrots.\n<code>\n$carrots = 4;\n$carrots_needed\
    \ = $carrots_to_eat;\n$carrots_left = 100 - $", "    \n    // Your code here\n\

    \ |>\nThis problem is pretty simple. I think what makes it hard is to think about\
    \ it in terms of \"how many carrots should I eat to complete the meal?\"\nThe\
    \ best case scenario is if you have one carrot left and you eat one carrot. That\
    \ one carrot is enough to finish the meal. The only other case is if you have\
    \ a lot left of carrots, and you eat as many carrots as you need. The best case\
    \ for that is to eat as many carrots as you can until you run out of carrots.\
    \ In that case, you eat your current carrots and then keep eating until you have\
    \ no carrots left.\nA simple way to solve it would be to start at 0, and work\
    \ backwards. If you're at 0 carrots left, keep eating until you have enough carrots.\
    \ If you have no carrots left after you started, go back to your original starting\

    \ |>\nYou have to find the first element in the array that is a multiple of 3.\
    \ The problem is that the first element in the array cannot be multiples of 3,\
    \ because then it would be the element 3 in the array and that would be a multiple\
    \ of 3.\nThe solution is to use modulo. As described in this wikipedia article\
    \ about the modulo operator:\n\nThe result of a % b is the remainder of the division\
    \ of a by b (rounded towards negative infinity). If a and b are both positive,\
    \ then the result of a % b is the same as a % |b|. If b is negative, a % b is\
    \ the remainder of a divided by |b|.\n\nSo the correct solution for your problem\
