    \ than the area of the triangle with length 5. This is a consequence of the fact\
    \ that in the case of a triangle, the area is proportional to the side length\
    \ (h) and the length of the base (a). In the case of a square, however, both values\

    \ your client, you'll need to set up a PHP page and send AJAX requests to it.\
    \ This page would then execute the query and return the results to the client.\
    \ Take a look at [this article](http://davidwalsh.name/php-mysql-ajax-database-interaction)\
    \ to get you started.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\n<code>\n$sql = \"SELECT id,user,date,time,title,description,username,picture,video,facebook,linkedin,twitter\
    \ FROM posts WHERE username = '\" . $username . \"'\";\n$result = mysql_query($sql);\n\
    while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n    $posts[] = $row;\n}\n</code>\n\
    $posts will have all the rows from your query. Now $posts['title'] will have the\
    \ post title. Hope this helps.\n<|/ a tags=javascript,php,mysql dscore=0 |>\n\
    <| c |>\n$posts isn't going to have any content for me to use on my page.  I need\
    \ to somehow access the MySQL database (which is working fine) and display the\
    \ results on the page (which is why I said I need to calculate the area of a triangle\
    \ using the data stored in the database).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYeah sorry i misunderstood\
    \ your question, i thought you wanted to get all the post details. If you just\
    \ need to display the titles then you will need to run another query and loop\
    \ through your posts array in php and display them by using a foreach.\n<|/ c\
