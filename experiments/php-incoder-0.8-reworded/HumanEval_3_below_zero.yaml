    The code above uses array_sum() to compute the sum of all the operations. Since\
    \ we are using negative operations to keep track of the balance, we have to subtract\
    \ the sum of negative values from all values. The sum of negative values is equal\
    \ to the sum of positive values minus the sum of negative values.\nSince we are\
    \ using array_sum() to compute the sum, we can use the optional second argument\
    \ for array_sum() which will return you the sum of all the array values. Since\
    \ we are using negative numbers to keep the balance, we subtract from all values\
    \ in the array to get a positive number.\n<|/ a tags=php |>\n<| c |>\nI think\

    I think the simplest solution is to use array_reduce to sum the elements and then\
    \ subtract from that value. This won't work for all cases, but for positive numbers\
    \ it is very simple, and for negative numbers it will give you the answer you\
    \ need.\n<code>\n$input = array(1, 2, -4, 5);\n", "    $sum = 0;\n    foreach\

    \ yes. As you understand from the code, that \"array\" is being added up in the\
    \ first two elements of `$operations`, because it's an array inside of an array.\
    \ But `0` is not an array and doesn't need to be checked for this.\n<|/ c |>\n\

    \ the $operations array is always going to be in descending order. Since this\

    <|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThis would also return false for negative values in\

    \ return true.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n- It does return true for negative values in\
    \ the middle of the array.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI didn't downvote but maybe because\
    \ you're not using the count function to see if the array has any negative values\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAh yes, you are correct, I was under the assumption that there\
