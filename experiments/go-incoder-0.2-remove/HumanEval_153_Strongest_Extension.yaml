  // The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The\n\

  // letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters\
  \ \n// in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM.\

  \ with the same strength, you should\n// choose the one that comes first in the\

  \ the\n// extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should\n//\
  \ return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension\
