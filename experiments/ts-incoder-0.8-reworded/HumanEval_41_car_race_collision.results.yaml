    \ easy: when n = 1, the cars collide in one iteration, and car_speed is 1, so\
    \ there's no need to check collisions at all.\nThe second part is trickier. Since\
    \ car_positions[1] is always strictly greater than 1, car_speed is always less\
    \ than 1, so the cars will never collide. However, car_positions[0] will still\
    \ be increasing while car_positions[1] is still strictly greater than 1 (and thus\
    \ car_speed will be increasing until eventually it overflows to 0). Thus, we can\
    \ reconstruct car_positions[0] and car_speed:\n<code>\nlet left_car_collisions\
    \ = car_race_collision(n - 1);\nlet right_car_collisions = car_race_collision(n\
    \ - 1);\nlet car_collisions = left_car_collisions + right_car_collisions;\n\n\
    let left_car_speed = car_positions[1] - car_positions[0];\nlet right_car_speed\
    \ = 1 - left_car_speed;\n</code>\nFrom this we can calculate the car's speed at\
    \ any point in time by adding left_car_speed and right_car_speed to car_positions[1]:\n\
    <code>\nlet car_speed = car_positions[1] + left_car_speed + right_car_speed;\n\
    </code>\nThe speed is always strictly positive, but it's often negative. Thus,\
    \ we can stop car_speed from going negative by checking whether it's greater than\
    \ 0:\n<code>\nif (car_speed > 0) {\n  ++collisions;\n}\n</code>\nIn other words,\
    \ this part checks the number of collisions when the car is moving rightwards:\n\
    <code>\nlet left_car_collisions = car_race_collision(n - 1);\nlet right_car_collisions\

    </code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the help.  I have the correct output, but\
    \ when I change the direction of car_x_len the program crashes.  What happens\
    \ is that the output changes from \"8\" to \"6\" when car_x_len is set to \"2\"\
    \ but when the value changes to \"4\", the program crashes.  Any idea why this\
    \ would be happening?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks.  I figured out the problem.\
    \  I just didn't know what was causing it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nGlad you figured\
    \ it out. Don't forget to mark it as correct if you feel like it. Cheers!\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nI figured out what was causing the crash.  I did not\
    \ know what was causing the crash and thought that maybe there was an issue with\
    \ the logic so I simplified the program to see if that might help me figure out\
    \ the problem.  It turns out that it was the logic that I didn't know what was\
    \ causing the crash.  The crash occurred when I changed car_x_len so that the\
    \ program started crashing.  I have included a picture of the crash and also the\
    \ code I used to simplify the problem.  Below is the code that I had to simplify\
    \ the problem.  The crash did not occur when I changed the code to only add one\
    \ car.  I believe the issue is caused by the logic of my program.  Any idea how\
    \ to fix this?\n<code>\ndeclare var require: any;\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\

    \ using my own code, is this:\n\nWe have to determine whether there is a collision\
    \ for every possible car (which is N^2 steps)\nWe know that there are only 2 cars,\
    \ and this means that there are only 2 possible collisions (N^2 combinations)\n\
    For every possible collision, there are 8 possible directions (4 directions x\
    \ 2 directions)\nFor each direction, we have to determine whether there is a collision\
    \ in all 8 directions\n\nIf we were to simplify the problem and solve the problem\
    \ in terms of cars, this would give us 4 cars each taking 8 steps, and thus 8\
    \ collisions N^2 times. The code would look something like this:\n<code>\ndeclare\
