    \ Memoization means storing the result to some Hash Table, where keys are the\
    \ values being calculated.\n<code>\npublic int eat(String a, String b, String\
    \ c){\n    int totalCarrots = Math.ceil((Integer.parseInt(a)-Integer.parseInt(b))/Integer.parseInt(c));\n\

    \ need to eat and remaining carrots. But how does this help? Well the memoization\
    \ saves the results of previously calculating values, so instead of recalculating\
    \ the same values over and over again, it just saves the result to a HashMap in\
    \ which key is calculated value and value is saved result. \n<code>", "  if (number\

    <| c |>\nThanks, it worked! Although my question was a bit different. Do you know\

    \ be like ```[1, 2, 1]``` for a meal of 5 and 10 carrots left.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nHmm. Interesting solution. I'll have to read into it a bit, but for now\
    \ it's perfect. Thanks for your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added another solution\
    \ below that will produce an array like you described.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=javascript\
    \ dscore=0 |>\nThe solution I found is somewhat ugly but is able to meet the requirements.\n\
    The idea is to keep track of which carrots you have eaten (you keep track of that\
    \ in an array of length 10) and which carrots you have left to eat (you keep track\
    \ of that in an array of length 10).\nA helper function checks to see which carrots\
    \ you have eaten (array) and which carrots you have left (array). \nWhen you have\
    \ eaten carrots that are greater than the array length and you add them to the\
    \ array, the remaining carrots should be subtracted.\nIf there are not enough\
    \ carrots to eat, you will add all remaining carrots to the array until the array\
    \ length. \nFinally, you will add all of the remaining carrots to an array and\
    \ return that array. \n<code>", "    let carrots: number[] = [];\n    let hungry\

    \ trouble understanding why the constraint is necessary. I know that this is an\
    \ issue for people who aren't paying attention, but can you help me understand\
    \ the constraint?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe constraint is needed because of the\
    \ fact that your meal plan has different requirements for how much carrots you\
    \ can get to eat and how many carrots you can eat before you get your meal plan\
    \ complete. For example, for one day you can eat as many as 5 carrots, but the\
    \ meal plan requires you to eat as few as 10 carrots before you can finish your\
    \ meal plan. So the constraint is to make sure you eat as many as 10 carrots before\
    \ you reach the meal plan requirements. It's possible you can eat less than the\
    \ meal plan requirement but you still need as many as you plan to eat.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nSo my suggestion is if you get passed the constraint to solve your\
    \ problem, you can also have it display the total carrots left before your next\
    \ meal plan. For example, if you plan to eat as many as 5 carrots, then display\
    \ the total number of carrots left (5 carrots) before you plan to eat any additional\
    \ carrots, otherwise, display the number of carrots you plan to eat. Hope that\
    \ helps. Let me know if you have any questions!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you\

    \ |>\nThis sounds like a homework problem that should be tagged as such if it\
    \ is.\nMy approach to this would be to break down the problem into steps and consider\
    \ each step individually as a programming exercise. Once you have each step working\
    \ you can combine them together into one function. \nSo for example:\nThe first\
    \ step is to take the number of carrots and determine the number of meals you\
    \ need to buy.\nYou will want to make sure you always have enough carrots before\
    \ you start eating so you will have to check whether you have enough carrots to\
    \ eat before you do the calculations. \nThe second step is to buy 12 carrots.\
    \ You can do this by first removing the number of meals you took away from the\
    \ number you had left. If you did this then you would be left with 8 carrots to\
    \ eat. \nThe third step is to eat the remaining carrots. \nThe final step is to\
    \ get 12 new meals and add those to the list of carrots you have eaten and decrease\
    \ the number of carrots you have left to eat.\n<|/ a |>\n<| a |>\nThis problem\
    \ can also be solved with dynamic programming. Basically, I define a table of\
    \ carrots that I will be using, for each \"state\" of my carrot-eating algorithm.\n\
    <code>\nvar carrots = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    carrotCount = 0;\n</code>\nAt each\
    \ state, I consider what I need to eat for the next 12 carrots and what carrots\
    \ I have.\n<code>\nvar currentCarrots = 0,\n    currentCarrotCount = 1;\n</code>\n\
    At each state, I take the number of carrots I need from the total carrots I have\
    \ left. If I still have carrots left, then I add my eating requirements to the\
    \ total carrots I have.\n<code>\nif (currentCarrots <= 12) {\n    carrots[currentCarrotCount]\
    \ = carrots[currentCarrotCount] + currentCarrots - 12;\n    carrotCount++;\n}\n\
    </code>\nThe output for carrotCount is as follows.\n<code>\n[3, 12, 4, 4, 9, 0]\n\
    </code>\nAs you can see, I have eaten 3 carrots and 12 ", "  if(remaining ===\
