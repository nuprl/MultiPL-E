    \ a symbol, use the quoting character `'`.\n\nFor example, `'a` evaluates to `a`,\
    \ and `'()` evaluates to `()` (the empty list).\n\nIn general, if `x` is any Racket\
    \ expression:\n\n```\n'x = x\n```\n\n```racket", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n",

    \ was <code>#lang racket</code>. That's so Racket knows it's looking at a Racket\
    \ program. Next, I defined a function <code>add</code> that takes two arguments\
    \ <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and returns the result of <code>(+ x y)</code>\
    \ which is the sum of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.\nNow we will load <code>main.rkt</code>\
    \ using Racket's REPL and play with our function <code>add</code>:\n<code>Welcome\
    \ to Racket v6.9.0.5.\n&gt; (load \"main.rkt\")\n&gt; (add 1 2)\n3\n&gt; (add\

    \ <code>add</code> to add different numbers together.\nI hope that helps.\n",

    I first use the <code>racket</code> command to compile and run a script:\n<code>$\

    \ then use the <code>raco</code> command to compile the script:\n<code>$ raco\
    \ exe racket/add.rkt\n\n$ racket racket/add.rkt\n\n/dev/null\n</code>\nThe compiled\
    \ script <code>add.rkt</code> also gives no output. I then use the Racket IDE:\n\
    <code>$ racket\n&gt; (load \"racket/add.rkt\")\n&gt; (add 1 2)\n3\n</code>\nThe\
    \ script runs in the IDE as expected.\nI'm using Racket version 6.1 on Ubuntu\
    \ 14.04 64-bit.\nThank you.\n\n\nA:\n\nScripts are different from compiled programs,\
    \ they're just a collection of definitions.  You need to put a statement at the\
    \ end of the script that actually executes some of the defined code.  Try this,\n\

    \ a Scheme REPL, e.g. the one invoked by <code>$ racket</code>.  I'm assuming\
    \ I need to export the functions I want to make use of, but I'm not sure how to\
    \ do this.  I've tried doing <code>(provide add)</code> at the end of my buffer,\
    \ then doing <code>(load \"add.rkt\")</code> in my REPL, but I get the error \"\
    provide: unbound identifier\".  I then tried prefixing the provide with <code>#:</code>\
    \ (without knowing what that meant), but that just gives me \"provide: bad syntax\
    \ in: (provide add)\".\nI can <code>(define (add x y) (+ x y))</code> in the REPL\
    \ and make use of it there.  What I'd like to do is export functions defined in\
    \ a file into the REPL.  Is this possible?\n\n\nA:\n\nYou want to use the <code>#lang</code>\

    \ 4\n\nWrite a function called `subtract` that takes two numbers and returns the\
    \ difference of those numbers.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nWrite a function called `reverse`\
    \ that takes a list and returns the list in reverse order.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n\
    Write a function called `count` that takes a list and returns the number of items\
