    \ is not very easy to understand. It would be much easier to understand if it\
    \ just returned <code>#f</code> whenever it encountered an \"extra\" closing bracket.\
    \ Also, the tail-recursion doesn't really add anything to the solution, except\

    \ solution that is actually easier to understand and think about.\n\n\nA:\n\n\
    Here's a translation of your code that I think will be easier to understand. You\
    \ start with a stack of <code>0</code>s, and a <code>#t</code> for the answer.\
    \ Then for each character in the string:\n\nIf it's <code>(</code>, push a <code>1</code>\
    \ onto the stack;\nIf it's <code>)</code>, remove a <code>1</code> from the stack\
    \ (unless it's empty, in which case the string isn't well-formed, so set the answer\
    \ to <code>#f</code>);\nOtherwise, do nothing.\n\nAfter you finish the entire\

    \ do this, use a helper function that takes the number of open brackets and the\
    \ remaining string. Also, a string can be treated like a list of characters, so\

    The problem with your implementation is that you're checking the outer parenthesis\
    \ pair, but when the <code>car</code> is not a <code>'(())</code> you're just\
    \ checking the next one, not the outer one. You should take the <code>car</code>\
    \ of the <code>cdr</code>'s result and then <code>cons</code> it to <code>car</code>\
    \ to get back to the outer one. Here's a refactored version that corrects this\
    \ problem:\n<code>(define (correct-bracketing brackets)\n  (define (cs stack)\n\
    \    (cond\n      [(empty? stack) true]\n      [(null? (car stack)) (cs (cdr stack))]\n\
    \      [else (and (eq? (car stack) '(()) '(()))\n                (cs (cons (car\
    \ (cdr stack))\n                          (cons (cdr (car stack))\n          \
    \                      (cdr (cdr stack))))))]))\n  (cs (cons (cons (car brackets)\
    \ '()) '())))\n</code>\nNow all the inner layers are checked properly. Let's test\

    You are using <code>and</code> when <code>all</code> would be better:\n<code>(all\

    \ only works with the string <code>brackets</code> and it assumes that the only\
    \ character that is of interest is <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>. A more general\
    \ function should have parameters that cover these things:\n<code>(define (correct-bracketing\
    \ brackets char-list) ...\n</code>\nYour function is too specific. It only works\
    \ with <code>strings</code>. A more general function should work with other types\

    \ to improve your code is to make it shorter. You can use <code>match</code> to\
    \ simplify the first <code>cond</code>. For example:\n<code>(define (correct_bracketing\
    \ brackets)\n  (define (helper brackets n)\n    (match brackets\n      ['() (and\
    \ (= n 0) #t)]\n      [(cons '#\\( b) (helper b (+ n 1))]\n      [(cons '#\\)\

    \ must only contain \\\"()\\\".\")]))\n  (helper (string-&gt;list brackets) 0))\n\
    </code>\nIf you want to make it even shorter you can use a library, for example\
    \ <code>srfi/1</code> and a different <code>match</code> library. Now that we\
    \ can use <code>fold</code> it's easier to build the <code>helper</code> function:\n\

    It seems like my solution is more complex than necessary. Is there a more elegant\
    \ solution to this problem?\n\n\nA:\n\nThe <code>recur</code> function is used\
    \ to create a loop by maintaining the \"state\" of the computation in the parameters.\
    \ A cleaner approach in Racket is to use the <code>let/cc</code> construct.\n\
    In the <code>let/cc</code> construct, the final expression (after the <code>in</code>)\
    \ is assumed to evaluate to a value, but it can also abort the computation by\
    \ using the <code>call/cc</code> procedure.\nThe following code demonstrates how\
    \ to use <code>let/cc</code> to avoid using an explicit <code>recur</code> function:\n\
    <code>(define (correct-bracketing? brackets)\n  (let/cc abort\n    (let loop ([s\
    \ (string-&gt;list brackets)]\n               [stack '()])\n      (cond\n    \
    \    [(empty? s)\n         (empty? stack)]\n        [(equal? (first s) #\\()\n\
    \         (loop (rest s) (cons #\\( stack))]\n        [(equal? (first s) #\\))\n\
    \         (or (empty? stack)\n             (abort (loop (rest s) (rest stack))))]\n\
    \        [else\n         (loop (rest s) stack)]))))\n</code>\nNote that I've changed\
    \ the name of the function to <code>correct-bracketing?</code> because the name\
    \ of functions in Racket use <code>-</code> instead of <code>_</code>. Also, note\
    \ how <code>abort</code", "  (define (aux brackets count)\n    (cond\n      [(empty?\
    \ brackets) (zero? count)]\n      [(equal? (first brackets) \"(\") (aux (rest\
    \ brackets) (+ count 1))]\n      [(equal? (first brackets) \")\") (and (aux (rest\
    \ brackets) (- count 1))\n                                         (&gt;= count\
    \ 1))]))\n  (aux brackets 0))\n</code>\nI tried to use <code>and</code> to use\
    \ the <code>aux</code> function as a predicate, so that it would return false\
    \ in case of an error, but then it will return true in case of an empty string.\n\
    So I need to use a helper function that will return false in case of an empty\
    \ string, or a wrong bracketing.\nHow do I do this without introducing a helper\
    \ function?\n\n\nA:\n\nI think that you have a conceptual issue here. If the function\
    \ <code>aux</code> is supposed to return <code>#t</code> when the brackets are\
    \ correct and <code>#f</code> otherwise, your predicate condition is wrong:\n\
    <code>(cond\n  [(empty? brackets) (zero? count)]\n  [(equal? (first brackets)\
    \ \"(\") (aux (rest brackets) (+ count 1))]\n  [(equal? (first brackets) \")\"\
    ) (and (aux (rest brackets) (- count 1))\n                                   \
    \  (&gt;= count 1))]))\n</code>\nIn your code, the evaluation of the first part\
    \ of the conditional expression <code>(and (aux (rest brackets) (- count 1))\n\
    \                                     (&gt;= count 1))</code> will always return\
    \ <code>#t</code>, because <code>aux</code> never returns <code>#f</code> (when\
    \ the brackets are wrong).\nI think that you can accomplish the same using <code>foldr</code>\
    \ and avoiding the creation of a helper function:\n<code>(define (correct_bracketing\
    \ s)\n  (foldr (lambda (ch acc)\n           (cond [(equal? ch #\\() (add1 acc)]\n\

    \ root, then you have the correct number of parentheses. If the tree is unbalanced,\
    \ then the number of parentheses is incorrect.\nThe logarithmic time comes from\
    \ the fact that a balanced tree of depth <code>d</code> can be built in <code>O(d)</code>\
