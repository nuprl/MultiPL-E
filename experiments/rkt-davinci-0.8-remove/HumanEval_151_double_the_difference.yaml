    \n\nA:\n\nYou're mixing up the <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code> forms. Note\
    \ that <code>let*</code> needs to start with a list of bindings, and each binding\
    \ should be a name and a value. For example:\n<code>(let* ([x 1]\n       [y 2])\n\
    \  (+ x y))\n=&gt; 3\n</code>\n<code>let</code> on the other hand expects the\
    \ bindings to be separated by commas. For example:\n<code>(let ([x 1]\n      [y\
    \ 2])\n  (+ x y))\n=&gt; 3\n</code>\nIn your code you're missing the commas and\
    \ the <code>*</code> in <code>let*</code>, plus you don't have a binding name\
    \ for the last binding:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n  (cond\n\

    A:\n\nThe Clojure version is obviously more compact, but I wouldn't say that it's\
    \ necessarily more readable. In this case, the Racket version is arguably more\
    \ readable, given that it splits the task in a series of steps, which are described\
    \ in the code.\nIMO, the Racket code is a bit verbose, but that's not necessarily\
    \ a bad thing: we've learned that it's better to break down complex problems into\
    \ smaller pieces, that are easier to understand, we've also learned that it's\
    \ better to make our code explicit, since in the long run it'll pay off better.\n\
    The following is an alternative version, which is more compact and arguably more\
    \ readable:\n<code>(define (double-the-difference lst)\n  (let ([evens (filter\
    \ even? lst)]\n        [odds (filter odd? lst)])\n    (- (* 2 (sum evens)) (sum\

    However, it would be better to use <code>foldLeft</code> or <code>foldRight</code>\

    \ form for testing functions. The form takes two\nexpressions, a function call\
    \ and an expected value. If the function call\nreturns the expected value, the\
    \ test passes. If not, the test fails.\n\nThe `check-expect` form throws an exception\
    \ if the test fails. To report\nthe test failure message, the `check-expect` form\
    \ must be run in a `with-handlers`\nform that catches the `exn:fail:check` exception.\n\
