    \ an entire list in a certain way, with each <code>&lt;-</code>?\nOr is there\
    \ a better way to write this function?\n\n\nA:\n\nI had to look up what your <code>derivative</code>\
    \ function does, but once I looked it up on wolframalpha, I realize it is actually\
    \ a lot simpler than what you are trying to do:\n<code>derivative :: (Num a) =&gt;\

    \ This time when it computes the recursive call, it expects the following:\n<code>(derivative\

    \ at which point the base case will be hit.\nYou're also using <code>zero?</code>\
    \ for your <code>null?</code> check. That's not necessarily a problem, but <code>null?</code>\
    \ is usually clearer. Additionally, you could use <code>add1</code> instead of\
    \ <code>(lambda (x) (+ x 1))</code> (though, the latter isn't a horrible way to\
    \ do it, of course).\nEDIT:\nTo actually explain what's happening in your code,\
    \ this is the line causing the error:\n<code>(multiply-polynomial (derivative\
