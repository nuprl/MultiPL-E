    \ instead of <code>cond</code> and get pretty much the same result, however it's\
    \ not the point of this question.\n\n\nA:\n\nThe problem is that, although <code>member</code>\
    \ is defined as a function that takes two arguments, the second of which is a\
    \ list, it actually takes <code>n</code> arguments where <code>n</code> is the\
    \ length of the list, but your code treats it as taking just two arguments.\n\
    The easiest way to fix this is to just <code>apply</code> <code>member</code>\
    \ to the values you have:\n<code>(define (uniq list)\n  (cond\n    [(empty? list)\
    \ empty]\n    [(apply member (first list) (rest list)) (uniq (rest list))]\n \
    \   [else (cons (first list) (uniq (rest list)))]))\n</code>\nBut that's a bit\
    \ of a hack, and the Racket standard libraries provide a better way. You can use\
    \ <code>any</code> with a <code>lambda</code> that returns <code>#t</code> if\
    \ the two values are equal:\n<code>(define (uniq list)\n  (cond\n    [(empty?\
    \ list) empty]\n    [(any (lambda (v) (equal? (first list) v)) (rest list)) (uniq\
    \ (rest list))]\n    [else (cons (first list) (uniq (rest list)))]))\n</code>\n\
    Another way to do this would be to sort the list, then run through it looking\
    \ for values that are the same as the previous value. This would be more efficient\
    \ than your current solution (it is O(n log n) instead of O(n^2)), but would not\
    \ preserve the ordering of the input.\n", "  (removed-duplicates/from-numbers/to-numbers\

    \ dropped and the order of elements will change.\nI'm also not sure if it's optimal\

    \ of the list that it searches, so your code is quadratic in time.  You can achieve\
    \ linear time by maintaining a set of the seen elements, instead of a list.  A\
    \ set is like a list, but only contains distinct elements and is implemented so\
    \ that lookups are efficient.  In Racket, sets are implemented by vectors, and\
    \ you can construct a vector from a list with <code>vector-&gt;immutable-vector</code>.\

    \ in a functional way with a fold, but I'm not sure how to remove the duplicates\
    \ as I see them and not after the fold has completed.\n\n\nA:\n\nYou can use <code>fold</code>\
    \ to build the result (reversed) list, but then you need to take care of reversing\
    \ it. Here's an example:\n<code>(define (remove-duplicates list)\n  (foldl (lambda\
    \ (el result)\n           (if (member el result)\n               result\n    \
    \           (cons el result)))\n         '()\n         list))\n</code>\nAlso,\
    \ I've simplified the procedure, since it doesn't need to take care of removing\
    \ duplicates as it goes. We can use the <code>member</code> function to check\
    \ if the element is already in the result list, in which case it won't be added\
    \ again.\nBut now we have the list in reverse order, we just need to reverse it\
    \ again to get the original order:\n<code>(define (remove-duplicates list)\n \
    \ (reverse (foldl (lambda (el result)\n                    (if (member el result)\n\
    \                        result\n                        (cons el result)))\n\
    \                  '()\n                  list)))\n</code>\nNote that the order\
    \ of the resulting list is preserved, and it only contains elements that occur\
    \ once, no duplicates:\n<code>(remove-duplicates '(1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4))\n=&gt; '(1\
