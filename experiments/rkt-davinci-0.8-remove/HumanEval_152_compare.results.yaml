    I am a beginner and I would appreciate if someone could help me to identify the\

    \ which one you're trying to fix:\n\nFirst, the result should be a list of <code>0</code>s\
    \ or <code>1</code>s, not <code>0</code>s or <code>-1</code>s. I think this was\
    \ a simple mistake in the question.\nSecond, you should use <code>cond</code>\
    \ not <code>cond-&gt;</code>. The latter is used when you have expressions that\
    \ need to be evaluated, not values that need to be compared. See the Racket documentation\
    \ on cond and cond-&gt;.\nThird, the result should be an <code>listof integer</code>,\
    \ not an <code>integer</code>. <code>integer</code> is a primitive type, while\
    \ <code>listof integer</code> is a list of integers. You can't compare a list\
    \ to an integer.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n<code>#lang racket\n\n(require\

    The first sub-task was to calculate the difference between two scores for example:\n\
    4,5 -> 1\n5,5 -> 0\nHowever, I am not sure how to compare between two lists of\
    \ values. My output is a list of true/false values and what I want is a list of\
    \ differences.\n\n\nA:\n\nYour first example\n<code>(cond [(= a b) 0]\n      [else\
    \ (abs (- a b))])\n</code>\ncould be expressed with a <code>let</code> form:\n\
    <code>(let ([diff (- a b)])\n  (if (= diff 0)\n      0\n      (abs diff)))\n</code>\n\
    And in this case, you could replace the <code>let</code> form with a <code>match</code>\
    \ form:\n<code>(match (- a b)\n  [0 0]\n  [x (abs x)])\n</code>\nNow that you've\
    \ got that down, you need to apply that to the pairs of elements in the two lists.\
    \  That's a job for <code>map</code>!\n<code>(map (lambda (a b)\n       (match\
    \ (- a b)\n         [0 0]\n         [x (abs x)]))\n     game\n     guess)\n</code>\n\
    \n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate compare))\n\

    <code>(define (compare game guess)\n  (for/list ([g game] [a guess])\n    (let\

    \ will evaluate to the absolute difference between <code>g</code> and <code>q</code>.\n\
    As the loop will return a list, <code>for/list</code> is being used instead of\
    \ <code>for</code>.\nThis <code>for</code> is equivalent to this <code>for/list</code>:\n\

    <code>(for/list ([i (in-range (length game))])\n  (abs (- (vector-ref game i)\
    \ (vector-ref guess i))))\n</code>\n\nLet's look at an example. \nGiven this <code>game</code>\
