    \nIt seems a two-fold problem:\nFirst, you're going through your lists front by\
    \ front. But you have to compare the whole of one list to the whole of the other,\
    \ to see if some combination of swaps exists.\nThen, you have to consider all\
    \ possible combinations (permutations), to find the one that satisfies the required\
    \ condition.\nThe solution is a bit hard to imagine, but it's not so hard to code.\n\
    The basic idea is to take one item at a time from <code>lst1</code>, and then\
    \ search all the items of <code>lst2</code> to see if there's one that can swap\
    \ with the selected item of <code>lst1</code>.\nIf no item in <code>lst2</code>\
    \ can be swapped, we should stop the search, and indicate that no solution was\
    \ found, because we cannot proceed further.\nIf there's at least one item from\
    \ <code>lst2</code> that can be swapped, we should then select", "  (cond\n  \

    It's not very readable, even if correct. The main problem is that the code doesn't\
    \ describe what it does, it just goes on and does it, as you've understood.\n\
    Let's first see what the code does, and then see how to make it more readable.\
    \ We have:\n<code>(define (exchange lst1 lst2)\n  (cond\n    [(or (not (null?\

    \ handled the empty lists, our solution is just a recursive call that takes care\
    \ of the rest of the list. Also, we are not doing any swapping, because we are\
    \ passing both lists as is to the recursive call.\nThe base case is when we reach\
    \ an empty list - that means that we've reached the end of the road for one of\
    \ the lists. Now it depends on which list we've found empty: if <code>lst1</code>\
    \ is empty, we immediately know the answer is <code>YES</code>, because we've\
    \ run out of numbers to exchange and at this point we can assume that the numbers\
    \ we've handled so far were even. On the other hand, if <code>lst2</code> is empty,\
    \ the answer is <code>NO</code> because we have more numbers to deal with in <code>lst1</code>\
    \ and we have no more numbers to exchange them with.\nNext, we handle the case\

    \ \n\n\nA:\n\nYes, you can use <code>cons</code> to add an element to the front\
    \ of a list:\n<code>(cons 1 '(2 3 4))\n=&gt; '(1 2 3 4)\n</code>\nNote that <code>cons</code>\
    \ is not a function, it's a special form, since it returns a new pair, but you\
    \ can pass it multiple arguments:\n<code>(cons 1 2 3 4)\n=&gt; '(1 2 3 4)\n</code>\n",

    So, I am a beginner to Racket, and I am having trouble getting this to work correctly.\n\
    I am not sure why it is not returning \"YES\" for every single time. I have tested\
    \ it manually and it seems to be that it works, so I am not sure what is going\
    \ on.\n\n\nA:\n\nThe best way to figure out a problem like this is to use the\
    \ \"debugger\". You can do this in DrRacket by clicking the \"Debug\" button.\
    \ Your code should be in a file, so that DrRacket can load it and run it.\nYou\
    \ can place a breakpoint at a line of code by clicking on the red circle at the\
    \ left side of the line.\nWhen you click \"Run\", the code will start executing.\
    \ When it reaches a breakpoint, the debugger will stop at that point, and show\
    \ you the current state of the program. \nYou can then step through the code line\
    \ by line, watching what the values of the variables are, and how they change.\
    \ \nHere's how you can use this to debug your program:\n\nPut the <code>exchange</code>\
    \ function inside a file in DrRacket\nPlace a breakpoint on the <code>if</code>\
    \ condition at the top of the function\nRun the program and call the function\
    \ with 2 numbers.\nStep into the <code>if</code> condition. What do you see? Why\
    \ is that happening?\nStep into the condition to see what happens next. Why does\
    \ this happen?\nGo through", "  (cond\n    [(odd? (first lst1))\n     (if (member\

    The problem is that it only works for the first list and not the second.\nExample:\n\
    <code>(exchange '(2 1) '(1 2)) =&gt; \"YES\"\n</code>\nBut this:\n<code>(exchange\
    \ '(1 2) '(2 1)) =&gt; \"NO\"\n</code>\nHow to make this work for both lists?\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nFirst of all, your code can be simplified considerably, by using <code>any</code>\
    \ and <code>all</code> predicates:\n<code>(define (exchange lst1 lst2)\n  (if\
    \ (any even? lst1)\n      \"YES\"\n      (if (any even? lst2)\n          \"YES\"\

    \ and check if there's a solution, you're going to need to implement a function\
    \ that:\n\nreceives a list,\ncreates a new list exchanging some element from the\
    \ first list with some element from the second,\nchecks if there's a solution\
    \ with the new list, and\nreturns <code>#t</code> if there's a solution, or <code>#f</code>\
    \ otherwise.\n\nThe base case for the recursive algorithm is when the two lists\
    \ are empty, and the recursive case is when one of the lists is not empty. The\
    \ function will perform the exchange and then recursively call itself with the\
    \ remaining elements from both lists. If any of the recursive calls returned <code>#t</code>,\
    \ that means we have a solution, so we return <code>#t</code>; if we exhaust all\
    \ possibilities and none of the recursive calls returned <code>#t</code>, then\
