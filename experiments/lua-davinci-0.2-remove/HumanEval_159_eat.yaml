prompt: "-- You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of\
  \ carrots,\n-- but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n\
  -- you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n\
  -- the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n-- if there are not enough remaining\
  \ carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n-- Example:\n\
  -- Variables:\n-- @number : integer\n-- the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n\
  -- @need : integer\n-- the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n-- @remaining\
  \ : integer\n-- the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n-- Constrain:\n\
  -- * 0 <= number <= 1000\n-- * 0 <= need <= 1000\n-- * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\
