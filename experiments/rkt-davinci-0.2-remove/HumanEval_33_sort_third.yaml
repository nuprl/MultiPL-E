    \ solution that uses a helper function to sort the third element of a list:\n\

    \             (cadddr lst)\n                                      (caddddr lst)\n\
    \                                      (cadddddr lst)))\n                    \

    You're using <code>sort</code> incorrectly. It expects a list of numbers, but\
    \ you're passing it a single number.\nYou can use <code>sort</code> on the third\

    \ a list first:\n<code>(sort (list (first (rest (rest l)))))\n</code>\n", "  (cond\n\

    \ be appreciated.\n\n\nA:\n\nYour code is almost correct, but you're not using\
    \ the <code>sort</code> function properly. The <code>sort</code> function takes\
    \ a <code>compare</code> function as an optional argument, and it's used to determine\
    \ the order of the elements in the list. For example, if we want to sort a list\
    \ of numbers in ascending order we can use this:\n<code>(sort '(3 1 2) &lt;)\n\
    =&gt; '(1 2 3)\n</code>\nBut if we want to sort a list of numbers in descending\
    \ order, we can use this:\n<code>(sort '(3 1 2) &gt;)\n=&gt; '(3 2 1)\n</code>\n\
    So in your case, you need to use the <code>sort</code> function with the <code>&gt;</code>\
    \ function as the <code>compare</code> argument, like this:\n<code>(define (sort_third\
    \ l)\n  (cond\n    [(empty? l) empty]\n    [(empty? (rest l)) l]\n    [(empty?\
    \ (rest (rest l))) l]\n    [else (append (list (first l) (second l) (sort (third\
    \ l) &gt;))\n                  (sort_third (rest (rest (rest l)))))]))\n</code>\n",

    \                        (sort_third (rest (rest (rest (rest l))))))))]))\n</code>\n\
    I'm not sure how to do this without using a cond statement. I'm also not sure\
    \ how to do this without using a helper function.\n\n\nA:\n\nHere's a solution\
    \ that uses <code>for/fold</code> and <code>for/list</code> to build the result\
    \ list. It's not the most elegant solution, but it's a good example of how to\
    \ use these two constructs:\n<code>(define (sort-third lst)\n  (for/fold ([acc\
    \ '()])\n            ([e (in-list lst)])\n    (if (zero? (modulo (length acc)\

    \ list of elements at positions that are not divisible by 3, and the second part\
    \ is the list of elements at positions that are divisible by 3. Then you can sort\
    \ the second part, and use <code>append</code> to put the two parts together.\n\
