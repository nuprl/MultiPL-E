prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has\
  \ to give the grades\n;; to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm\
  \ for grading.\n;; The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.\n\
  ;; She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write \n;;\
  \ a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:\n\
  ;; GPA       |    Letter grade\n;; 4.0                A+\n;; > 3.7             \
  \   A \n;; > 3.3                A- \n;; > 3.0                B+\n;; > 2.7      \
  \          B \n;; > 2.3                B-\n;; > 2.0                C+\n;; > 1.7\
  \                C\n;; > 1.3                C-\n;; > 1.0                D+ \n;;\
  \ > 0.7                D \n;; > 0.0                D-\n;; 0.0                E\n\
