    \ to iterate over the list, and check if the element is in the list. If it is,\
    \ I want to return the row and column of the element.\nI've tried to use <code>sub1</code>\
    \ to get the index of the row, and <code>length</code> to get the index of the\
    \ column.\nHowever, I'm getting the following error:\n<code>for: bad syntax in:\
    \ (for/list ([row lst] #:when (member x row)) (cons (length (take row (sub1 (length\
    \ lst)))) (length (take x row))))\n</code>\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nThe problem is that you're using <code>for/list</code> in a wrong way,\
    \ the syntax is:\n<code>(for/list ([var-id expr] ...) body-expr ...+)\n</code>\n\
    Where <code>var-id</code> is the variable that will be bound to the elements of\
    \ the list produced by <code>expr</code>. In your case you're trying to bind <code>row</code>\
    \ to the list <code>lst</code>, but that's not how <code>for/list</code> works.\n\
    The solution is to use <code>for/list</code> to iterate over the rows of the matrix,\
    \ and then use <code>for/list</code> again to iterate over the elements of each\
    \ row, this way:\n<code>(define (get-row matrix x)\n  (for/list ([row matrix]\n\
    \             #:when (member x row))\n    (for/list ([col row]\n             \
    \  #:when (= x col))\n      (cons (length row) (length col)))))\n</code>\n", " \
    \ (for/list ([row lst]\n             #:when (member x row))\n    (cons (length\
    \ (take row))\n          (length (take-while (lambda (y) (not (equal? x y))) row)))))\n\
    </code>\nI'm not sure if I'm on the right track, but I'm getting a weird error:\n\
    <code>cons: expects argument of type &lt;non-negative exact integer&gt;; given:\
    \ #&lt;procedure:length&gt;\n</code>\nI'm not sure what's going on here.\n\n\n\
    A:\n\nYou're trying to use <code>length</code> as a procedure, but it's not a\
    \ procedure, it's a function.\n<code>length</code> is a function that takes a\
    \ list and returns an integer.\n<code>length</code> is not a procedure that takes\
    \ an integer and returns a list.\nYou can't use <code>length</code> as a procedure\
    \ in <code>for/list</code> because <code>for/list</code> expects a procedure that\
    \ takes an element of the list and returns a value.\n", "  (for/list ([row lst]\n\
