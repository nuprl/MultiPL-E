prompt: "#!/bin/bash\n# You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents\
  \ a single well,\n# and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.\n# Each\
  \ well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, \n\
  # and all buckets have the same capacity.\n# Your task is to use the buckets to\
  \ empty the wells.\n# Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.\n\
  # Example 1:\n# >>> $(max_fill \"0 0 1 0\\n0 1 0 0\\n1 1 1 1\" \"1\")\n# \"6\"\n\
