  # Example 1:\n# >>> $(even_odd_palindrome \"3\")\n# ['\"1\"', '\"2\"']\n# Explanation:\n\
  # Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\
  # Example 2:\n# >>> $(even_odd_palindrome \"12\")\n# ['\"4\"', '\"6\"']\n# Explanation:\n\
  # Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and\
