prompt: "#!/bin/bash\n# Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by\
  \ mathematicians in \n# the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know\
  \ is Tribonacci sequence.\n# Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\n\
  # tri(1) = 3\n# tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n# tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n\
  \ - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\n# For example:\n# tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n\
  # tri(4) = 3\n# tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n# = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n# You are\
  \ given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the \n#\
  \ first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n# Examples:\n# >>> $(tri \"3\"\
  )\n# ['\"1\"', '\"3\"', '\"2\"', '\"8\"']\n#\n# $1 is an integer\ntri() {\n"
