prompt: "#!/bin/bash\n# Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n\

  \ list with a sorted order,\n# The list is always a list of strings and never an\
  \ array of numbers,\n# and it may contain duplicates.\n# The order of the list should\
  \ be ascending by length of each word, and you\n# should return the list sorted\
  \ by that rule.\n# If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n\
  # The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n# You may assume\
  \ that all words will have the same length.\n# For example:\n# >>> $(list_sort \"\
  aa a aaa\")\n# ['\"aa\"']\n# >>> $(list_sort \"ab a aaa cd\")\n# ['\"ab\"', '\"\
