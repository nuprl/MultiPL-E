    \ a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the\
    \ number of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime,\
    \ is a natural number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller\
    \ natural numbers).\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\
    \ A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So\
    \ you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B\
    \ (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always\
    \ correct or empty string, \n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n\
    \    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"\
    1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should\
    \ be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num\
    \ = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \
