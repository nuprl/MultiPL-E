    \ and checkings. Savings accounts start off with a balance and can withdraw money\
    \ from the account and deposit money into it. Checking accounts start off with\
    \ no money in them and can only deposit money into them. Write a program that\
    \ uses loops to allow the user to deposit and withdraw money from the bank accounts.\
    \ At the end of the program, print out how many checking and savings accounts\
    \ were created, and how many checking and savings accounts were overdrawn.\n\n\
    The program should allow the user to deposit money into the account and withdraw\
    \ money from the account. After the program is run, the program should display\
    \ how many checking and savings accounts were created, and how many checking and\
    \ savings accounts were overdrawn.\n\nThe program should allow the user to deposit\
