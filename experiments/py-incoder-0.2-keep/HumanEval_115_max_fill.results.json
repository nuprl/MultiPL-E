We will use a dictionary to store the nodes. \nThe key of the dictionary will be the row and the value will be the column of the node.\n\nThe grid of nodes will be represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary will be initialized as follows:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1): 3}\nThe dictionary is initialized with 0 flow. \nThe dictionary is represented as a dictionary where the key is the row and the value is the column.\n\nThe dictionary is initialized with the following values:\n\ngrid = {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, \ndef check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 1) == 6\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]], 2) == 5\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], 5) == 0\n    assert candidate([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 2) == 4\n    assert candidate([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 9) == 2\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(max_fill)\n\ntest_check()\n",
