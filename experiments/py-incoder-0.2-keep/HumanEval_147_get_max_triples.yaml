    Problem 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1)\
    \ = 1\nF(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), where F(k) = F(k - 1) + F(k - 2), \nfor k =\
    \ 0, 1, ..., n - 1.\n\nFor example, F(10) = 55 and F(11) = 89.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(0), we reach the base case where F(0) = F(1) = F(2) = 0, \nand F(3) =\
    \ F(4) = F(5) = F(6) = 1, and so on.\n\nBy considering the terms in the Fibonacci\
    \ sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued\
    \ terms.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \
