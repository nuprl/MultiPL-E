    <|/ a tags=julia |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the answer. Can you please explain why\

    \ statement is just to make sure that the addition doesn't overflow the integer\
    \ type. Since `Int64` can only hold integers up to 2^63-1, the addition will never\
    \ overflow the integer type. Since `x + y` will always return a `Int64` value,\

    \ |>\nThe other answers here are all great, but I wanted to add that you can also\
    \ use ifelse, which is a vectorized version of if:\n<code>\njulia> ifelse(x <\

    \ c |>\n`ifelse` is an extremely useful function in Julia. One of the most useful\

    \ that you can also use ifelse, which is a bit more readable than if/else and\
    \ also allows you to use multiple conditions:\n<code>\njulia> ifelse(x < y, x\
    \ + y, y + x)\n5", "    if x < 0 || y < 0\n        error(\"add: negative arguments\"\

    Julia has two types of functions: pure and impure. Pure functions are those that\
    \ do not have any side effects. Impure functions are those that do have side effects.\
    \ \nIn Julia, pure functions are defined using the function keyword. Impure functions\
    \ are defined using the function keyword. \n<code>", "    if x < 0 || y <= 0\n\

    \ |>\nThis answer is based on a previous answer by that uses type annotations.\
    \ I wanted to add some additional information to that answer, which I believe\
    \ is helpful.\nThe type annotations allow you to specify what type a variable\
    \ is expected to be. For example, if you have a variable x of type Int64, then\
    \ x is expected to hold an Int64 value. This can be done by using the type annotation:\n\
    <code>\nx = Int64\n</code>\nHowever, if you try to assign a value of type Float64\
    \ to a variable of type Int64, you will get an error:\n<code>\nx = Float64\nERROR:\
    \ LoadError: MethodError: no method matching +(::Float64, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates\
    \ are:\n  +(::Any, ::Any) at operators.jl:430\n  +(::Any, ::Any...) at operators.jl:430\n\
    \  +(::Any, ::Int64) at operators.jl:430\n  ...\nStacktrace:\n [1] top-level scope\
    \ at none:0\n</code>\nThe error tells you that Julia is trying to add two values\
    \ of different types. This is because Julia is trying to add two values of type\
    \ Float64 and Int64. Julia is trying to add two values of type Float64 and Int64,\
    \ but since Float64 and Int64 are different types, it cannot add them.\nThe type\
    \ annotations allow you to specify what type a variable is expected to be. For\
    \ example, if you have a variable x of type Int64, then x is expected to hold\
    \ an Int64 value. This can be done by using the type annotation:\n<code>\nx =\
    \ Int64\n</code>\nHowever, if you try to assign a value of type Float64 to a variable\
    \ of type Int64, you will get an error:\n<code>\nx = Float", "    if x == 0 ||\

    \ dynamically typed, which means that it can do things like this:\n<code>\njulia>\
