    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm still trying to understand how this\

    \ it to `factorials`. I don't understand why `factorials[1] = 1` and `factorials[2]\
    \ = factorials[1] * factorials[2]` work. Could you please explain how this works?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`factorials[1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `factorials[1]`.\
    \  `factorials[2] = factorials[1] * factorials[2]` assigns the value `factorials[1]\
    \ * factorials[2]` to `factorials[2]`.  `factorials[1] * factorials[2]` returns\
    \ the product of all the numbers from 1 to `n`.  `factorials[1] * factorials[2]`\
    \ returns `factorials[1] * factorials[2]` because `factorials[1] * factorials[2]`\
    \ is assigned to `factorials[2]`.  `factorials[1] * factorials[2]` returns `factorials[1]\
