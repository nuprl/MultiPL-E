prompt: "\"\"\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two vectors\
  \ of numbers,\n    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange\
  \ of elements\n    between them to make lst1 a vector of only even numbers.\n  \
  \  There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n\
  \    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n\
  \    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return\
  \ \"NO\".\n    For example:\n    >>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])\n    \"\
  YES\"\n    >>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])\n    \"NO\"\n    It is assumed\
  \ that the input vectors will be non-empty.\n    \"\"\"\nfunction exchange(lst1::Vector{Int64},\
