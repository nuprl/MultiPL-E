    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n\

    \ exchange of elements\nbetween them to make lst1 a vector of only even numbers.\n\
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n\
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\nall\
    \ the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\nOtherwise, return \"NO\".\n\
    For example:\n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])\n\"YES\"\n>>> exchange([1,\
    \ 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])\n\"NO\"\nIt is assumed that the input vectors will be\

    \ function that takes two vectors of numbers, and determines whether it is possible\
    \ to perform an exchange of elements\nbetween them to make lst1 a vector of only\
    \ even numbers.\nThere is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between\
    \ lst1 and lst2.\nIf it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and\
    \ lst2 to make\nall the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\nOtherwise,\
    \ return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])\n\"YES\"\
    \n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])\n\"NO\"\nIt is assumed that the input\
    \ vectors will be non-empty.\nHint: You may want to use the function exchange()\

    \ 3\nWrite a function that takes two vectors of numbers, and determines whether\
    \ it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\nbetween them to make lst1\
    \ a vector of only even numbers.\nThere is no limit on the number of exchanged\
    \ elements between lst1 and lst2.\nIf it is possible to exchange elements between\
    \ the lst1 and lst2 to make\nall the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\"\
    .\nOtherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2,\
    \ 3, 4])\n\"YES\"\n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])\n\"NO\"\nIt is assumed\
    \ that the input vectors will be non-empty.\nHint: You may want to use the function\
    \ exchange defined above.", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\

    \ 3\nWrite a function that takes two vectors of numbers, and determines whether\
    \ it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\nbetween them to make lst1\
    \ a vector of only even numbers.\nThere is no limit on the number of exchanged\
    \ elements between lst1 and lst2.\nIf it is possible to exchange elements between\
    \ the lst1 and lst2 to make\nall the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\"\
    .\nOtherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2,\
    \ 3, 4])\n\"YES\"\n>>> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])\n\"NO\"\nIt is assumed\
    \ that the input vectors will be non-empty.\nHint: You may want to use the function\

    \ 7\nWrite a function that takes two vectors of numbers, and determines whether\

    \    There is no limit on the number of swap operations between lst1 and lst2.\n\
