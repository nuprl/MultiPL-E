    \ but I thought I'd add some explanation.\nThe reason why Julia's sort function\
    \ doesn't work is because it's designed to work on arrays of numbers. But your\
    \ vector is of Int64 type. Julia's sort function works on arrays of numbers by\
    \ converting them to Int64 first. \n<code>\njulia> sort([5, 1, 4, 3, 2])\n5-element\
    \ Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 5\n 2\n</code>\nThe reason why this works is because\
    \ Julia knows that Int64 is the same as Int. \n<code>\njulia> typeof(Int64)\n\
    Int64\n</code>\nSo the sort function can work on Int64 vectors. \n<code>\njulia>\
