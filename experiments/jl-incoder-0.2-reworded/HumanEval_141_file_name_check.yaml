prompt: "\"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name,\

  \    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions\
  \ \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in\
  \ the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The\
  \ substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from\
  \ \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the\
  \ dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\
