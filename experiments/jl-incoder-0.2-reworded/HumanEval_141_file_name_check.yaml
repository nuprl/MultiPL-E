prompt: "\"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name,\

  \    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions\
  \ \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in\
  \ the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The\
  \ substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from\
  \ \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the\
  \ dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\

    <text>\nExercise 2\nWrite a function that takes a string representing a file's\
    \ name, and returns the file's extension.\nA file's extension is considered to\
    \ be valid if and only if all the following conditions are met:\n- There should\
    \ not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's extension.\n- The file's\
    \ extension contains exactly one dot '.'\n- The substring before the dot should\
    \ not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin \nalphapet ('a'-'z'\
    \ and 'A'-'Z').\n- The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt',\
    \ 'exe', 'dll']\nExamples:\n>>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n\"txt\"\n>>>\

    <text>\nExercise 4\nWrite a function that takes a string representing a file's\
    \ name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No'\
    \ otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the\
    \ following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three\
    \ digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly\
    \ one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it\
    \ starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n\
    \    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n\
    \    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n    \"Yes\"\n    >>>\
    \ file_name_check(\"1example.dll\")\n    \"No\"\n    \"\"\"", "    \n    if file_name.count(\"\
