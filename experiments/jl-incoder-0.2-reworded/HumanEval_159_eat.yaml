    \ 3\nWrite a function that returns the number of carrots left after eating a certain\
    \ number of carrots.\nIf there are not enough carrots left after eating a certain\
    \ number of carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n\
    The function should take in two inputs:"]

- "\nfunction"
- "\nmacro"
- "\n\n"
