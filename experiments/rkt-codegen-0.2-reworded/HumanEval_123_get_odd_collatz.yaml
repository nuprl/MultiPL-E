    \ a sequence defined\n;; as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each\
    \ term is obtained from the \n;; previous term as follows: if the previous term\
    \ is even, the next term is one half of\n;; the previous term. If the previous\
    \ term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n;; term plus 1. The conjecture\
    \ is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n;; Note:\
    \ \n;; 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n;; 2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\
    ;; For example:\n;; get_even_collatz(5) returns [2, 4] # The collatz sequence\
    \ for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the even numbers are only 2, and 4.\n;; >>>\
