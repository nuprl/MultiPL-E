    \ grid.\n    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length\
    \ k) if\n    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A\
    \ and B go\n    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically\
    \ less\n    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i\

    \    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n \
