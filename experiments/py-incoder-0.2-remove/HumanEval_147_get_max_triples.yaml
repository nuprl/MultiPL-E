    <text>\nProblem 4\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nFn = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nFor example,\
    \ F(10) = 55 and F(100) = 99.\n\nBy starting with F(0), you can calculate the\
    \ value of F(n) for all n \u2265 1.\n\nFlipping the formula to solve for F(n):\n\
    \nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) - F(n-2)\n\nFor example, F(10) = 55 and F(100) = 99.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(1), you can calculate the value of F(n) for all n \u2265\

    <text>\nProblem 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nFn = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\nFor example,\
    \ F(10) = 55 and F(100) = 39.\n\nThe first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence\
    \ are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nBy starting with F(1),\
    \ you can compute the next term in the sequence by adding the previous two terms.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(2), you can compute the next two terms in the sequence by\
    \ adding the previous two terms.\n\nBy repeating this process, eventually you\
    \ will reach the term that produces the longest chain of Fibonacci terms.\n\n\
    F(100) = 399168005, and the longest chain ends with term 40755.\n\nBy using the\
    \ formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), compute the longest Fibonacci chain ending at\
    \ term 40755.\n\nHINT: Recall that F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\

    \ 1.\n\nBy starting with F(1), you can compute the sequence F(n) by adding the\
