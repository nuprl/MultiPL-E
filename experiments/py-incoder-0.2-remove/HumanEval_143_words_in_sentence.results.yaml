    Write a Python program to find the longest common substring between two given\
    \ strings.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\nstr1 = \"computer\"\nstr2 = \"omputer\"\n\n\
    Output:\n\"omputer\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe longest common substring between str1\
    \ and str2 is \"omputer\".\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\nstr1 = \"computer\"\nstr2\
    \ = \"mputer\"\n\nOutput:\n\"mputer\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe longest common substring\
    \ between str1 and str2 is \"mputer\".\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\nstr1 = \"computer\"\
    \nstr2 = \"mputers\"\n\nOutput:\n\"mputer\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe longest common\
    \ substring between str1 and str2 is \"mputer\".\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\nstr1\
    \ = \"computer\"\nstr2 = \"computer\"\n\nOutput:\n\"computer\"\n\nExplanation:\n\
    The longest common substring between str1 and str2 is \"computer\".\n\nExample\
    \ 5:\n\nInput:\nstr1 = \"computer\"\nstr2 = \"computer\"\n\nOutput:\n\"computer\"\
    \n\nExplanation:\nThe longest common substring between str1 and str2 is \"computer\"\
