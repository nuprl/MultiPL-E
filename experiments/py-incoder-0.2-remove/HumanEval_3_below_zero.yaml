    \ and Withdrawal\nNow that you have implemented the above functions, you will\
    \ have another task to do. Implement the function deposit_withdraw() that takes\
    \ in a list of deposit and withdrawal operations and returns the updated account\
    \ balance.\n\nThe function should return True if the account balance is below\
    \ zero, and False otherwise. You may assume that all deposits and withdrawals\
    \ are valid.\n\nExample: deposit_withdraw([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\
    \ 5], [5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,\

    Now that you've seen how to use loops to solve a problem, let's see how we can\
    \ use loops to solve a problem with multiple deposits and withdrawals.\n\nThe\
    \ bank has two types of accounts: savings and checkings. A savings account has\
    \ a deposit limit of $1000. Savings accounts can have multiple deposits and withdrawals.\
    \ A checking account has a deposit limit of $2000. Checking accounts can have\
    \ multiple deposits and withdrawals. Write a program that simulates the bank's\
    \ deposit and withdrawal operations.\n\nThe program should keep track of the current\
    \ balance of the account, as well as the number of deposits and withdrawals performed.\
    \ You may assume that an account always has a balance of $0.\n\nThe program should\
    \ also keep track of the number of times the program has executed the deposit\
    \ and withdrawal functions. You may assume that an account always has a balance\
    \ of $0.\n\nThe program should also keep track of the number of times the program\
    \ has executed the deposit and withdrawal functions. You may assume that an account\
    \ always has a balance of $0.\n\nThe program should also keep track of the number\
    \ of times the program has executed the deposit and withdrawal functions. You\
    \ may assume that an account always has a balance of $0.\n\nThe program should\
    \ also keep track of the number of times the program has executed the deposit\
    \ and withdrawal functions. You may assume that an account always has a balance\
    \ of $0.\n\nThe program should also keep track of the number of times the program\
    \ has executed the deposit and withdrawal functions. You may assume that an account\

    <text>\nProblem 7\nWrite a function that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal\
    \ operations on a bank account and returns the number of operations that would\
    \ result in the account being in zero balance.\n\nFor example, given the following\
    \ deposit and withdrawal operations:\n\ndeposit(100), withdrawal(50), deposit(100),\
    \ withdrawal(50), deposit(100), withdrawal(50), deposit(100), withdrawal(50),\
    \ deposit(100), withdrawal(50)\n\nyour function should return 7, as there are\
    \ 7 operations that would result in zero balance.\n\nHint: You can use the sum()\
    \ function to add up all the elements in a list.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    \n\

    \ implemented the below_zero function, you will implement the deposit and withdrawal\
    \ functions.\n\nYour deposit function should take in two arguments: the first\
    \ is the amount of the deposit and the second is the current balance of the account.\
    \ The function should return the new balance after depositing the amount in the\
    \ first argument. If the second argument is less than 0, the function should return\
    \ 0.\n\nYour withdrawal function should take in two arguments: the amount withdrawn\
    \ and the current balance of the account. The function should return the new balance\
    \ after withdrawing the amount in the first argument. If the second argument is\
    \ less than 0, the function should return 0.\n\nYour deposit and withdrawal functions\
    \ will use these helper functions to help you implement the banking logic.\n\n\
    The helper function deposit should take in the amount and the current balance\
    \ of the account and return the new balance.\n\nThe helper function withdrawal\
    \ should take in the amount withdrawn and the current balance of the account and\
    \ return the new balance.\n\nNote that this function will never allow a negative\
    \ balance to be withdrawn or deposited. Also, the function will raise an exception\
    \ if you pass in an amount that is less than 0.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    \n\

    \ and Withdrawal\nNow that you've seen the basics of deposit and withdrawal, let's\
    \ see how we can use them in our bank account class. We'll start by defining a\
    \ class BankAccount that inherits from the Account class. We'll then define two\
    \ methods: deposit and withdrawal. We'll then define two attributes: balance and\
    \ account_number.\n\nThe deposit method should accept a positive integer as an\
    \ argument and should add that integer to the current balance of the account.\
    \ For example, if the balance is $100 and you call deposit(50), then the balance\
    \ should be $150.\n\nThe withdrawal method should accept a positive integer as\
    \ an argument and should subtract that integer from the current balance of the\
    \ account. For example, if the balance is $100 and you call withdrawal(50), then\
    \ the balance should be $90.\n\nFinally, the balance method should return the\
    \ current balance of the account. For example, if the balance is $100 and you\
    \ call balance(), then the balance should be $100.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "  \

    \ is below zero, let's see if we can use it to detect if an operation is below\
    \ a certain threshold. Recall that an operation is below a threshold if its value\
    \ is less than or equal to the threshold. For example, if the threshold is 5,\
    \ then an operation with a value of 5 would be below the threshold, but an operation\
    \ with a value of -5 would not be below the threshold.\n\nThe function below takes\
    \ in a list of operations and a threshold and returns the list of operations that\
    \ is below the threshold. Make sure to only use operations below the threshold\
    \ in the list of operations.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    \n    \n    \n    \n\
