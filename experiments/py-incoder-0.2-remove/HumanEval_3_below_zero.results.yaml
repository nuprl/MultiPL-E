    The deposit method should accept a positive integer as an argument and should\

    \ subtract that integer from the current balance of the account. For example,\
    \ if the balance is $100 and you call withdrawal(50), then the balance should\
    \ be $90.\n\nFinally, the balance method should return the current balance of\
    \ the account. For example, if the balance is $100 and you call balance(), then\
