    \ sum of a sub-array of nums, we know that we\n    can only use nums[i] to find\
    \ the minimum sum of the sub-array [nums[i], nums[i + 1]].\n    \n    So if we\
    \ try to find the minimum sum of a sub-array of nums, we know that we\n    can\
    \ only use nums[i] to find the minimum sum of the sub-array [nums[i], nums[i +\
    \ 1]].\n    \n    So if we try to find the minimum sum of a sub-array of nums,\
    \ we know that we\n    can only use nums[i] to find the minimum sum of the sub-array\
    \ [nums[i], nums[i + 1]].\n    \n    So if we try to find the minimum sum of a\
