    \ is a simple solution, with a very obvious problem:\n    it's very slow, because\
    \ for each function call, 3 arrays are created,\n    and 3 arrays are passed to\
    \ the function. \n    In addition, in order to perform mathematical operations\
    \ and condition check,\n    the Julia compiler must create \"symbol tables\" and\
    \ \"function call stack\", \n    in order to check for errors, exception throwing,\
    \ etc...\n    Thus, the final solution has a time complexity of O(n^3).\n    \n\
    \    This solution aims to improve the run time complexity, by using \"inlining\"\
    \n    and by pre-allocating the arrays.\n    In order to achieve this, I've created\
    \ the following helper function:\n    \n    function inlinedEat(count::Vector{Int64},\

    \ (remaining - need)>0 ? (remaining - need) : 0\n    end\n    \n    This functions\
    \ has two main advantages:\n    1. The arrays are passed by reference, meaning\
    \ that you don't create \n       more arrays to pass to the function.\n    2.\
