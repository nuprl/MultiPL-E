    \ problem:\n    it's very slow, because for each function call, 3 arrays are created,\n\
    \    and 3 arrays are passed to the function. \n    In addition, in order to perform\
    \ mathematical operations and condition check,\n    the Julia compiler must create\
    \ \"symbol tables\" and \"function call stack\", \n    in order to check for errors,\
    \ exception throwing, etc...\n    Thus, the final solution has a time complexity\
    \ of O(n^3).\n    \n    This solution aims to improve the run time complexity,\
    \ by using \"inlining\"\n    and by pre-allocating the arrays.\n    In order to\
    \ achieve this, I've created the following helper function:\n    \n    function\
    \ inlinedEat(count::Vector{Int64}, need::Int64, remaining::Int64)\n        count[1]\
    \ += need\n        count[2] = (remaining - need)>0 ? (remaining - need) : 0\n\
    \    end\n    \n    This functions has two main advantages:\n    1. The arrays\
    \ are passed by reference, meaning that you don't create \n       more arrays\
    \ to pass to the function.\n    2. The arrays are pre-allocated, meaning that\
    \ you don't need to create\n       new arrays inside the function.\nusing Test\n\
