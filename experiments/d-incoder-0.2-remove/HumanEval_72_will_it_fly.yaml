    \ I understand your solution, but I cannot understand why you use \"long max_weight\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nBecause the maximum possible weight is `w`, so `max_weight`\
    \ should be `int`. The reason is because `int` can hold any number between `0`\
    \ and `2^32-1`, while `long` can hold any number between `0` and `2^64-1`. So\
    \ `max_weight` should never be greater than `w`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you\

    \ Can you please explain me why you used `std.array` instead of `System.Array`?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used `std.array` because I wanted to use an `array` from\
    \ the standard library. `System.Array` would not work. `System.Array` does not\
    \ have a `Length` property. `std.array` does.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see. Thanks\
