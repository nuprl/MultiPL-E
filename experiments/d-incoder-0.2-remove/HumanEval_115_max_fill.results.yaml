    \ works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe idea is to find the number of ways to fill the\
    \ grid with the maximum capacity without exceeding the capacity. For example,\
    \ if the grid is `1 0 1 0 1` and capacity is `3`, then there are 3 ways to fill\
    \ the grid with capacity `3`: `1 0 1 0 1`, `1 0 1 0 0` and `1 0 1 0 0`. The number\
    \ of ways to fill the grid with capacity `3` is `3` because there are 3 ways to\
    \ fill the grid with capacity `3`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand that there\

    <| c |>\nThanks for your answer. Can you please explain how you came up with this?\
    \ I understand that you are trying to find the number of ways to fill the grid\
    \ but I don't understand how you came up with this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used\
    \ the fact that you can only use 1 bucket to extract water from each well. So,\
    \ if you have N wells and M buckets, you can extract M water from each well in\
    \ N ways. So, the number of ways to fill the grid is equal to the number of ways\
    \ to extract M water from each well in N ways.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see what\
