    This is not the correct solution. Your solution does not take into account the\
    \ fact that prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and by 1 and the number\
    \ itself. For example `count_up_to(10)` should return `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\
    \ 19, 23]` but your solution returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31,\
