    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThis is not an answer, but a comment.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree,\
    \ this is more of a comment than an answer. However I believe it does answer the\
    \ question as asked.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI believe this answer should be the accepted\
    \ answer. Although it does use recursion, it does not use recursion to compute\
    \ the Fibonacci sequence. Instead, it uses recursion to compute the Fibonacci\
    \ heap sequence. Fibonacci heap sequences are a special case of Fibonacci sequences.\
    \ In fact, Fibonacci heap sequences are the Fibonacci sequences modulo some number\
    \ that is usually the square root of the largest Fibonacci number in the sequence.\
    \ For example, FibHeap(5) is the Fibonacci sequence modulo 5, FibHeap(10) is Fibonacci\
    \ sequence modulo 10, FibHeap(25) is Fibonacci sequence modulo 25, FibHeap(50)\
    \ is Fibonacci sequence modulo 50, and so on. FibHeap(100) is the Fibonacci sequence\
    \ modulo 100.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe question asked for \"a way to compute Fibonacci\
    \ numbers without recursion\". This answer does exactly that. Fibonacci heap sequences\
    \ are a special case of Fibonacci sequences. In fact, Fibonacci heap sequences\
    \ are the Fibonacci sequences modulo some number that is usually the square root\
    \ of the largest Fibonacci number in the sequence. For example, FibHeap(5) is\

    \ the Fibonacci sequence as a recursive function and not a loop? I thought that\
    \ would be the most efficient way to implement the Fibonacci sequence since it\
    \ requires no extra memory and doesn't require any extra calculations. I guess\
