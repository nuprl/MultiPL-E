    I like your solution, but I believe it can be optimized a little bit more. Instead\
    \ of iterating over all elements of the array and comparing them to the current\
    \ minimum, we can just iterate over the array and compare the elements with the\
    \ current minimum. Also, we don't need to store the whole array in memory, we\
    \ can just store the current minimum and compare it with the next element in the\
    \ array. Finally, we can just return the current minimum.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
