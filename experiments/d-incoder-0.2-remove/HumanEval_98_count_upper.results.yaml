    This doesn't answer the question. He wants to count the number of uppercase vowels\

    \ handle multiple uppercase vowels.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I agree, my code doesn't\
    \ handle multiple uppercase vowels. I didn't want to write an answer that would\

    \ again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=c++,string,arrays |>\nThe reason your code doesn't\
    \ work is because you never increment i after you increment count. \n<code>\n\
    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)\n{\n    if(i % 2 == 0)\n    {\n        if(s[i]\
    \ == 'A' || s[i] == 'E' || s[i] == 'I' || s[i] == 'O' || s[i] == 'U')\n      \
    \      count++;\n    }\n}\n</code>\nWhen you increment count you never increment\
    \ i so you never get to the end of the loop. \n<code>\nfor(int i = 0; i < s.length();\
    \ i++)\n{\n    if(i % 2 == 0)\n    {\n        if(s[i] == 'A' || s[i] == 'E' ||\
    \ s[i] == 'I' || s[i] == 'O' || s[i] == 'U')\n            count++;\n    }\n  \
