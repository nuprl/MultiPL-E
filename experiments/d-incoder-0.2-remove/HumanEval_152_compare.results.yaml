    \ your answer! I appreciate it. I tried your solution and it works. However, I\
    \ do have a question. Why do you use \"long[] result = new long[game.Length];\"\
    \ instead of \"long[] result = game;\"? I understand that \"game\" is a reference\
    \ to a location in memory where game[] is stored. Why do you use \"new long[game.Length]\"\
    \ instead of \"game\"? Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used `long[] result\
    \ = game` because I wanted to show that you can assign a reference to a variable\
    \ and that variable can then be modified by reference. `long[] result = new long[game.Length]`\
    \ creates a new array and assigns it to the variable `result`. So the variable\
    \ `result` now references the new array. `game` was the original array and `result`\
    \ was the new array. `game` was modified by reference but `result` was not.\n\
