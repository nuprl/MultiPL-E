    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. Your solution is very similar to mine.\
    \ My solution has O(n^3) complexity, yours has O(n^2). I am wondering if there\
    \ is a way to improve my solution to O(n^2)?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, you can\
    \ improve it by using a hash table to count the number of 1's in each row. Then,\
    \ for each row, you can just subtract the number of 1's from the capacity and\
    \ add 1 to the number of 1's in the row that has fewer 1's than the capacity has.\n\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. Can you please explain how this solution\
    \ works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe idea is to find the number of ways to fill the\
    \ grid with the maximum capacity without exceeding the capacity. For example,\
    \ if the grid is `1 0 1 0 1` and capacity is `3`, then there are 3 ways to fill\
    \ the grid with capacity `3`: `1 0 1 0 1`, `1 0 1 0 0` and `1 0 1 0 0`. The number\
    \ of ways to fill the grid with capacity `3` is `3` because there are 3 ways to\
    \ fill the grid with capacity `3`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand that there\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used a similar approach to solve this problem. But the problem\
    \ was to find the maximum number of water that can be extracted from each well.\

    \ from it. So I used the fact that each well is filled with the maximum number\
    \ of water that can be extracted from it (which is equal to the number of water\
    \ that can be extracted from each well). So I used the fact that each well is\
    \ filled with the maximum number of water that can be extracted from it (which\
    \ is equal to the number of water that can be extracted from each well). So I\

    <| a tags=algorithm,dynamic-programming,c++,c,arrays |>\nThe problem is that the\
    \ number of ways to empty a row is equal to the number of ways to empty a column.\
    \ \nSo the problem is reduced to finding the number of ways to empty a row and\
    \ column. \nThe solution is to use dynamic programming. \nThe idea is to store\
    \ the number of ways to empty a row and column in a 2D array. \nThe first row\
    \ and column will store the number of ways to empty a row and column. \nThe rest\
    \ of the array will store the number of ways to empty a row and column when it\
    \ is empty. \nThe base case is when all the elements are empty. \nThe recursive\
    \ case is when there is one element left in the row or column. \nThe recursive\

    <| c |>\nThank you for your answer. Can you please explain me how you did this\
    \ algorithm? I mean how did you find out the number of times to lower the buckets?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used a brute force approach. First I counted the number of\
    \ times each bucket needed to be lowered to empty the wells. Then I used the maximum\
    \ value of this count to find the maximum number of times to lower the buckets.\n\
