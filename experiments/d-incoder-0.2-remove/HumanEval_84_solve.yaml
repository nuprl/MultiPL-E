    The main problem is that you do not reset the sum to zero after each iteration.\
    \ Thus the sum is accumulating from previous iterations. \n<code>\nlong sum =\
    \ 0;\nwhile (N > 0)\n{\n    remainder = N % 2;\n    sum += remainder;\n    N =\
    \ N / 2;\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nI appreciate your efforts, but\
