    <|/ a tags=c#,arrays |>\n<| c |>\nI like the idea of using an array, but I believe\
    \ this would only work if the two arrays are the same length. Since they are not,\
    \ the program would have to compare the two arrays in pairs, right? So the program\
    \ would have to compare the first element in the first array with the first element\
    \ in the second array, and then the second element in the first array with the\
    \ second element in the second array, and so on. Is that correct?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYes, that is correct. Since you are comparing each element in the first\
    \ array with the first element in the second array, then each element in the second\
    \ array with the second element in the second array, and so on. As long as you\
    \ have the correct number of elements to compare, the program will work. Try it\
    \ out and see if it works.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI tested it out and it works perfectly.\

    \ |>\nThanks for your answer! I appreciate it. I tried your solution and it works.\
    \ However, I do have a question. Why do you use \"long[] result = new long[game.Length];\"\
    \ instead of \"long[] result = game;\"? I understand that \"game\" is a reference\
    \ to a location in memory where game[] is stored. Why do you use \"new long[game.Length]\"\
    \ instead of \"game\"? Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used `long[] result\
    \ = game` because I wanted to show that you can assign a reference to a variable\
    \ and that variable can then be modified by reference. `long[] result = new long[game.Length]`\
    \ creates a new array and assigns it to the variable `result`. So the variable\
    \ `result` now references the new array. `game` was the original array and `result`\
    \ was the new array. `game` was modified by reference but `result` was not.\n\
