    \ |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm still a beginner at Java, so I appreciate your\
    \ help. I understand your code, but I'm having trouble understanding how it works.\
    \ I understand that you're creating a while loop that will continue to run until\
    \ carrots is greater than zero, but I don't understand how it works. How does\
    \ it know to stop when carrots is greater than zero? Also, why are you using carrots\
    \ -= carrotsNeeded? Why not carrots -= carrotsRemaining? Thanks again!\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThe while loop will continue to run until carrots is greater than\
    \ zero. carrots -= carrotsNeeded is because carrotsNeeded is how many carrots\
    \ you want to eat, and carrots -= carrotsRemaining is because carrotsRemaining\
    \ is how many carrots you have left. carrots -= carrotsNeeded is because carrotsNeeded\
    \ is how many carrots you want to eat, and carrots -= carrotsRemaining is because\
    \ carrotsRemaining is how many carrots you have left.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay,\

    Yes, you can copy and paste it into your code. Just make sure you replace `int\
    \ carrots = 1000;` with your actual number of carrots. You can put it in a separate\
    \ file if you want, but I don't think it's necessary. Just make sure you replace\
    \ `carrots = carrots - carrotsEaten;` with your actual number of carrots eaten.\
    \ Just make sure you replace `carrotsLeft = carrots - carrotsEaten;` with your\
    \ actual number of carrots left.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay, thank you so much!\

    \ combination of carrots you have eaten so far and carrots you have left to eat,\
    \ you can calculate the number of carrots you can eat to complete the meal. \n\
    The base case is when you have eaten all carrots and have left to eat all carrots.\
    \ Then the answer is simply the total number of carrots you have eaten. \nThe\
    \ recursive case is when you have eaten a certain number of carrots and have left\
    \ to eat another certain number of carrots. Then the answer is simply the total\
    \ number of carrots you have eaten plus the number of carrots you have left to\
