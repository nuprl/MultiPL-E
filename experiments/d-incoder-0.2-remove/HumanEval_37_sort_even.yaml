    <|/ a tags=sorting,arrays,java |>\n<| c |>\nI like your solution, however I believe\
    \ it can be optimized a little more. Since you are sorting the array in place,\
    \ there is no need to copy the array into another array and sort it there. Instead,\
    \ you can just swap the values at even indices and then sort the array in place.\
    \ Also, you don't need to sort the array in place, you can just sort it in-place\
    \ by swapping the values at even indices and then sorting the array in place.\n\
