prompt: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// We have an array 'arr' of\
  \ N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n// numbers in the array will be randomly\
  \ ordered. Your task is to determine if\n// it is possible to get an array sorted\
  \ in non-decreasing order by performing \n// the following operation on the given\
  \ array:\n// You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.\n\
  // One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one\n//\
  \ position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to\n\
  // the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. \n// If it is possible to\
  \ obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation\n// then return True\
  \ else return False.\n// If the given array is empty then return True.\n// Note:\
  \ The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n// For Example:\n// >>>\
  \ move_one_ball((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)1, (long)2})))\n\
  // (true)\n// Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing\
  \ order can\n// be achieved for the given array.\n// >>> move_one_ball((std::vector<long>({(long)3,\
  \ (long)5, (long)4, (long)1, (long)2})))\n// (false)\n// Explanation:It is not possible\

  \ right shift operations.\nbool move_one_ball(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"
