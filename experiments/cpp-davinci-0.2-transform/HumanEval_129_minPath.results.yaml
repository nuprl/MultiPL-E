  program: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given a grid with N rows\
    \ and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n// each cell of the grid\
    \ contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n// inclusive appears\
    \ exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n// You have to find the minimum path\
    \ of length k in the grid. You can start\n// from any cell, and in each step you\
    \ can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n// in other words, you can go to cells\
    \ which share an edge with you current\n// cell.\n// Please note that a path of\
    \ length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n// necessarily distinct).\n//\
    \ You CANNOT go off the grid.\n// A path A (of length k) is considered less than\
    \ a path B (of length k) if\n// after making the ordered lists of the values on\
    \ the cells that A and B go\n// through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A\

    \ contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n// inclusive appears\

    \ which share an edge with you current\n// cell.\n// Please note that a path of\
    \ length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n// necessarily distinct).\n//\
    \ You CANNOT go off the grid.\n// A path A (of length k) is considered less than\
    \ a path B (of length k) if\n// after making the ordered lists of the values on\

    \ contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n// inclusive appears\

    \ which share an edge with you current\n// cell.\n// Please note that a path of\
    \ length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n// necessarily distinct).\n//\
    \ You CANNOT go off the grid.\n// A path A (of length k) is considered less than\
