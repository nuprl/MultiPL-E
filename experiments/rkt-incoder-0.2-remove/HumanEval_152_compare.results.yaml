    \ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for the answer. I am still trying to understand\
    \ how this works. I understand that you are comparing each element of the two\
    \ arrays and setting the score and guesses accordingly. I am confused on how you\
    \ get the absolute difference between the two scores. I understand that you are\
    \ taking the absolute difference between the two scores. But how do you get the\
    \ absolute difference between the two guesses?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe absolute\
    \ difference is simply the difference between the two scores. I added a section\
    \ to my answer to show how this can be done in one loop.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
