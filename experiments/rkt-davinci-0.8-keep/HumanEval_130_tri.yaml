prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply\
  \ by mathematicians in \n;; the last couple centuries. However, what people don't\
  \ know is Tribonacci sequence.\n;; Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\n\
  ;; tri(1) = 3\n;; tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n;; tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n\
  \ - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\n;; For example:\n;; tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n\
  ;; tri(4) = 3\n;; tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n;; = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n;; You\
  \ are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the\
  \ \n;; first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n;; Examples:\n;; tri(3)\
