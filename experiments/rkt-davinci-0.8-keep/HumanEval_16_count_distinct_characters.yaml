    Is there a better way to write this? How would you go about solving this problem?\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nThere's a bug in your program. Consider what happens if the string is\
    \ \"aaa\". In that case, the second clause will never be executed and we'll end\
    \ up returning 0. Your procedure should throw an error if it gets an empty string.\n\
    The rest of your program is fine. There is an alternative way of solving this\
    \ problem though. The key idea is to use <code>sort</code> to put the characters\
    \ in the string in alphabetical order. Next, we use <code>list-head</code> to\
    \ look at the first element of the sorted list. If the list consists of only one\
    \ element, then we're done. Otherwise, we look at the first element again, and\
    \ compare it to the next one. If they're the same character, then we keep going.\
    \ If they're different, then we increment the count. This is repeated until all\
    \ the elements have been looked at.\n<code>(define (count-distinct-characters\

    \ they just used the <code>char-alphabetic?</code> function to check if a character\
    \ is a letter or not. Isn't this a problem? What if the input is \"abC\". I have\
    \ solved this problem, but theirs are not correct.\nHow can I improve my code?\
    \ I am missing something?\nDoes my code \"look like\" Scheme?\n\n\n\nA:\n\nIn\
    \ Scheme everything is an expression, so it is idiomatic to avoid <code>void</code>\
    \ when you don't care about the result. The two <code>void</code> expressions\
    \ in your code are just ignored, so you can drop them.\n<code>(define (count_distinct_characters\

    \ you are trying to define a function which takes an <code>String</code> (i.e.\
    \ a list of <code>Char</code>s) and returns the number of unique characters in\
    \ the string, and that you only care about the case of the characters, you can\
    \ use <code>group</code> and <code>length</code>.\n<code>count_distinct_characters\
    \ :: String -&gt; Int\ncount_distinct_characters = length . group . sort . map\
    \ toUpper\n</code>\n<code>sort</code> is used to order the characters before <code>group</code>ing\
    \ them, as <code>group</code> only groups adjacent elements. <code>map toUpper</code>\
    \ is used to convert all characters to uppercase. The <code>.</code> function\
    \ (the composition operator) is used to compose the functions.\n", "  (length\

    Can someone give me any hint?\n\n\nA:\n\nThere are a few problems with your code.\
    \ The first one is that you're not splitting the string correctly: you're passing\
    \ a number <code>#\\</code> instead of the character <code>#\\space</code> (notice\
    \ the lack of quotation marks).\nThe second problem is with your <code>if</code>\
    \ expression: you're using <code>not</code> when you really mean to use <code>and</code>.\
    \ The third problem is that you're using <code>member</code> incorrectly, you're\
    \ passing the wrong arguments: <code>letter</code> and the list <code>(rest (string-split\
    \ string #\\))</code>. Also, the <code>rest</code> is redundant since <code>member</code>\
    \ does not modify the list that is being searched, it just returns a boolean.\n\
    Given the above, I would write the function like this:\n<code>(define (count-distinct-characters\
    \ str)\n  (if (string=? str \"\")\n      0\n      (length (filter (lambda (x)\
    \ (not (member x (string-split str #\\space))))\n                      (string-split\
    \ str #\\space)))))\n</code>\nBut notice that <code>member</code> is not tail-recursive,\
    \ so this is not very efficient. A better alternative is to use <code>foldl</code>:\n\
    <code>(define (count-distinct-characters str)\n  (if (string=? str \"\")\n   \
    \   0\n      (foldl (lambda (x xs) (if (member x xs) xs (cons x xs)))\n      \
    \       '()\n             (string-split str #\\space))))\n</code>\n", "  (length\
    \ (sort (remove-duplicates (append-map (lambda (char) (string-upcase char)) string))\
    \ string<?)))\n)\n</code>\nBut it gives me this error:\n<code>Type Checker: Polymorphic\
    \ function `append-map' could not be applied to arguments:\n\nArgument 1:\n  Contract\
    \ Violation\n  Expected: String?\n  Given: Char\n</code>\nHow do I solve this?\n\
    \n\nA:\n\n<code>append-map</code> expects a function that takes a <code>String</code>\
    \ and returns a <code>List</code> of <code>String</code>s, but <code>(lambda (char)\
    \ (string-upcase char))</code> takes a <code>Char</code> and returns a <code>String</code>.\n\
    Instead, use <code>map</code> with <code>string-upcase</code>, which takes a <code>String</code>\
    \ and returns a <code>String</code>:\n<code>(map string-upcase string)\n</code>\n",
  "  (length (remove-duplicates (string-&gt;list (string-downcase string)))))\n",

    \ string-upcase string)) ; to upper case\n  (length (remove-duplicates string)))\
    \ ; remove duplicates\n</code>\nAny suggestions?\n\n\nA:\n\nWell, this is definitely\
    \ one way to do it\n<code>(define (count_distinct_characters string)\n  (set!\
    \ string (string-&gt;list string)) ; string-&gt;list\n  (set! string (map string-upcase\
    \ string)) ; to upper case\n  (length (remove-duplicates string))) ; remove duplicates\n\
    </code>\nI would suggest a different approach though.\n<code>(define (count_distinct_characters\
    \ string)\n  (set! string (string-&gt;list string)) ; string-&gt;list\n  (set!\
    \ string (map string-upcase string)) ; to upper case\n  (length (remove-duplicates\
    \ string))) ; remove duplicates\n</code>\nFirst off, try not to use <code>set!</code>\
    \ (mutable variables) in Racket. If you can do it with a recursive function then\
    \ that's a much better idea.\nYour <code>count_distinct_characters</code> also\
    \ doesn't have the correct arity. Racket procedures can have multiple arities,\
    \ but you only have the one, so you need to have an additional <code>()</code>\
    \ after the <code>-&gt;</code>.\nSomething like\n<code>(define (count_distinct_characters\
    \ string)\n  (set! string (string-&gt;list string)) ; string-&gt;list\n  (set!\
    \ string (map string-upcase string)) ; to upper case\n  (length (remove-duplicates\
    \ string))) ; remove duplicates\n</code>\nNote that <code>string-&gt;list</code>\
    \ can be done with <code>string-&gt;list</code> in the Racket documentation. Also,\
    \ <code>string-upcase</code> is <code>string-upcase</code>. And <code>remove-duplicates</code>\
    \ is <code>remove-duplicates</code>.\nFinally,", "  (length (remove-duplicates\
    \ (string-&gt;list (string-upcase string)))))\n", "  (length (delete-duplicates\
