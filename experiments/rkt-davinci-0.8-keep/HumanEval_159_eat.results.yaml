    \        [else\n           (list eaten (- remaining eaten))])))\n```\n\nFrom the\
    \ problem statement, we get input in the form of three numbers. The first is the\
    \ number of carrots we've already eaten, the second is the number of carrots we\
    \ need to eat, and the third is the number of carrots left in the world. If we\
    \ need more carrots than are left, we return a list where the first element is\
    \ the number of carrots left and the second element is zero. If not, we return\
    \ a list where the first element is the number of carrots eaten and the second\
    \ element is the number of carrots left in the world.\n\nUsing `let` makes it\
    \ easy to calculate the `eaten` value. Then we just need to check if we've eaten\
    \ more carrots than were left. If so, we return a list where the first element\
    \ is the number of carrots left in the world and the second element is zero. If\
    \ not, we return a list where the first element is the number of carrots eaten\
    \ and the second element is the number of carrots left in the world.\n\nI think\
    \ I see where the problem is. The problem statement says that we should return\
    \ an array, but Racket doesn't have arrays. We can return a vector, which will\
    \ be mapped to a JavaScript array, but it's probably not what they meant. Also,\
    \ the function inputs and outputs are integers, but Racket doesn't have integers.\
    \ We can use `#:restrict-type` to restrict the inputs to integers, but the outputs\
    \ are still inexact numbers.\n\nI'll just submit the code and see what happens.\n\
    \n**Update:** I got a \"Wrong answer\" error. I'll try fixing the obvious issues\
    \ first.\n\n## Solution: JavaScript\n\n```js\nfunction eat(number, need, remaining)\
    \ {\n  let eaten = number + need;\n  if (eaten > remaining) {\n    return [remaining,\
    \ 0];\n  } else {\n    return [eaten, remaining - eaten];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Solution:\
    \ Elixir\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Eat do\n  def eat(number, need, remaining) do\n\
    \    eaten = number + need\n    if eaten > remaining do\n      {remaining\n(require\

    \ programming paradigm is not for everybody.\n- Most languages are multi-paradigm.\
    \ They can used in multiple ways.\n- Most people program in an imperative style,\
    \ with loops, etc.\n- We're doing functional programming to prove that we can\
    \ do it.\n- Our programs will be simpler, but they will be harder to follow.\n\
    - We need to take advantage of the syntax to make our programs more readable.\n\
    \n- We will be using `racket` because it's easy to use in a web browser.\n\n-\
    \ To run the Racket code, you need to change the language to `Racket` and click\
    \ the `Run` button in the upper right.\n\n- You can also run the code in a `racket`\
    \ shell, but you need to install `racket` on your machine.\n\n- The `racket` shell\
    \ is just `racket` with a REPL.\n\n- A REPL is a read-eval-print loop.\n\n- The\
    \ REPL in the language lab is called `DrRacket`.\n\n- We will be using `DrRacket`\
    \ for the next few lectures.\n\n- The `lang` in `#lang racket` is a language.\n\
    \n- The `lang` is the name of the language.\n\n- Any code that comes after the\
    \ `lang` is treated in that language.\n\n- The `#lang` begins a comment in `racket`.\n\
    \n- We can use this `#lang` comment to tell the REPL what language the code should\
    \ be treated as.\n\n- We can also use the `#lang` comment to set the language\
    \ in DrRacket.\n\n- `racket` is just one of the languages that can be run in DrRacket.\n\
    \n- We are going to do functional programming in `racket`.\n\n- `racket` is based\
    \ on the Scheme family of languages.\n\n- The Scheme family of languages includes\
    \ `Scheme`, `Racket`, `Kawa`, and `Pedestal`.\n\n- `Scheme` is very small and\
    \ has few features.\n\n- `racket` is based on `Scheme`, but has many more features.\n\

    The reason that I have three cases is that the <code>number</code> of carrots\
    \ eaten in the past could be larger, smaller, or equal to the <code>need</code>\
    \ for the day's meals.\nThe first case (if <code>number</code> is greater than\
    \ <code>need + remaining</code>) is a special case where the number of carrots\
    \ eaten would be absurdly large, so I just return <code>(0 0)</code> instead.\n\
    Otherwise, I consider the three cases of <code>number</code> being greater than,\
    \ equal to, or less than <code>need</code>.\nIn the first two of those cases,\
    \ if <code>need</code> is greater than <code>remaining</code>, I return a list\
    \ of the number of carrots eaten and how many are left.\nOtherwise, I return a\
    \ list of how many carrots remain and how many carrots were eaten.\nIn the last\
    \ case (where <code>number</code> is less than <code>need</code>), if <code>number</code>\
    \ is greater than <code>remaining</code>, I return a list of <code>remaining</code>\
    \ followed by <code>remaining</code>.\nOtherwise, I return a list of <code>number</code>\
    \ followed by <code>remaining</code>.\n\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval)\
