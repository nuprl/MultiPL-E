    <code>|dividend - quotient * divisor|\n</code>\n\nEdit:\nI am not a mathematician,\
    \ but I think I figured out why the quotient of the product is always <code>0</code>\
    \ or <code>1</code>.\nSince <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are positive, <code>a*b</code>\

    \ your own, as in the following example:\n<code>(define (modulo a b)\n  (if (&lt;\

    \ sure how to fix this. I'm fairly new to racket and I'm stumped.\n\n\nA:\n\n\
    There are two ways to define a function. One is through a <code>define</code>\
    \ special form, and the other is through a <code>lambda</code> special form. A\
    \ <code>define</code> special form will wrap a <code>lambda</code> expression\
    \ for you:\n<code>(define (foo)\n  'foo)\n</code>\nis a shorthand for\n<code>(define\
    \ foo\n  (lambda ()\n    'foo))\n</code>\nIn your case, you have defined a function\
    \ called <code>multiply</code> which takes two arguments, but you didn't call\
    \ it. \n<code>(define (multiply a b)\n  (remainder (abs a) 10) * (remainder (abs\
    \ b) 10))\n</code>\nIf you want to call it, you should just call it:\n<code>(multiply\
    \ 10 3)\n</code>\n", "  (* (remainder a 10) (remainder b 10)))\n</code>\n", " \
    \ ;(display (+ (modulo a 10) (modulo b 10)))\n  (+ (modulo a 10) (modulo b 10)))\n",
  "  (modulo (modulo a 10) (modulo b 10)))\n</code>\nNow I'm wondering if this is\
    \ the most elegant solution.\nCan someone please try to improve the solution or\
    \ check if it's valid?\nThanks!\n\n\nA:\n\nFirst of all, your solution doesn't\
    \ work. It fails when the inputs are negative.\nTo get the last digit of a positive\
    \ integer, you can use <code>modulo</code> to take the remainder when dividing\
    \ by 10:\n<code>(modulo number 10)\n</code>\nIf <code>number</code> is negative,\
    \ you can negate it, then do the same:\n<code>(modulo (- number) 10)\n</code>\n",
  "  (display (modulo (abs a) 10))\n  (display (modulo (abs b) 10))\n  (modulo (*\
    \ (modulo (abs a) 10) (modulo (abs b) 10)) 10))\n</code>", "  (let ((a (modulo\
    \ a 10))\n        (b (modulo b 10)))\n    (* a b)))\n", "  (define (power a b)\n\
    \    (cond\n      [(zero? b) 1]\n      [else (* a (power a (- b 1)))]))\n  (define\

    \   [else 1]))\n  (* (unit a) (unit b) (power 10 (+ (abs (- (sign a) (sign b)))\
    \ 1))))\n</code>\nThe question is about pattern matching on numbers, and I would\
    \ think that the way to go was to pattern match on the sign of the numbers and\
    \ check if they are both equal or different and add 1 to the power of 10 (since\
    \ 10 can't have a 0 at the beginning), but I'm stuck with the numbers that are\
    \ negative. I would need to add 1 to the power of 10, but if I do <code>(power\
    \ 10 (+ (abs (- (sign a) (sign b))) 1))</code> and <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>\
    \ are negative, I would end up adding 1 to the power of 10 twice since <code>(sign\
    \ a)</code> and <code>(sign b)</code> would both return -1. Do you have any suggestions\
    \ on how I can fix this?\n\n\nA:\n\nHere's a way to do this using simple arithmetic\

    The <code>modulo</code> operation is exactly what you need, since you want to\

    \ b) 10))\n</code>\nThe problem is that is not work. In the Repl it shows \"Language:\
    \ racket; Memory Limit: 3GB; Time Limit: 10 sec\" and I don't know what is the\
    \ problem.\nI just want the function to be working. \nI have even tried to write\
    \ the function directly in the Repl but the same problem is.\nI have read about\
    \ the racket documentation and I don't find anything.\n\n\nA:\n\nThe problem here\
    \ is that the test cases are calling <code>multiply</code> with other arguments\
    \ than <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, for example:\n<code>(multiply 'a 'b)\n\
    </code>\nSince this expression evaluates to <code>17280</code>, your solution\
    \ will fail the test cases and you'll get an \"Incorrect\" verdict.\nOne way to\
    \ solve this problem is to check that the input arguments are numbers before computing\
    \ the result:\n<code>(define (multiply a b)\n  (if (and (number? a) (number? b))\n\
    \      (modulo (* a b) 10)\n      \"Wrong input!\"))\n</code>\n", "  (round (*\
    \ (remainder a 10) (remainder b 10))))\n", "  (let* ([a-digits (modulo a 10)]\n\

    \ (* a b) 10))\n", "  (modulo (modulo a 10) (modulo b 10)))\n</code>\nI was trying\
    \ to do a small exercise where I needed to multiply only the last digit of two\
    \ numbers. For example, multiply(148, 412) would be 4*2 = 8.\nI was surprised\
    \ that the modulo function is not taking the negative numbers correctly. I did\
    \ the same exercise in Python and I could get the right answer. \n<code>Python:\n\
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = -15\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = -14\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a%10\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\
    \ b%10\n6\n</code>\nI have read about the remainder function in Racket, but for\
    \ now, I couldn't figure out how to use it to solve this problem.\n\n\nA:\n\n\
    From the docs:\n<blockquote>\n<p>Calculates the remainder of the division of x\
    \ by y. If x and y are both integers, then the result is exact. If x and y are\
    \ both inexact numbers, then the result is inexact; <strong>if x and y are both\
    \ exact numbers, then the result may be inexact</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
    So you need to convert your exact number to an inexact one. For example:\n<code>(define\
    \ (multiply a b)\n  (modulo (exact-&gt;inexact (modulo a 10))\n          (exact-&gt;inexact\
    \ (modulo b 10))))\n</code>\n", "  (define (last-digit a)\n    (remainder a 10))\n\

    \ and multiply them together, then it seems like it would be easier to use <code>remainder</code>\
    \ and <code>quotient</code> to extract the digits and then recursively call the\
    \ <code>mult</code> function. Here's a quick example of what I mean:\n<code>(define\
    \ (mult a b)\n  (cond\n    [(or (= 0 a) (= 0 b)) 0]\n    [(zero? (remainder a\
    \ 10)) 0]\n    [(zero? (remainder b 10)) 0]\n    [else\n     (+ (remainder a 10)\n\

    \ inside of another? I suppose it is, but I don't like it too much.\nIf you have\
    \ any other comments, please do not hesitate to give them.\nThanks in advance.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nIn general it is acceptable to write functions within other functions,\
    \ but you should use it with care and document it well, so that the user of the\
    \ function is aware of its existence.\nYour code is pretty well documented, using\
    \ a doc string that explains the input and output for each function, you're using\
    \ correct indentation, and the name of each function clearly reflects its purpose.\n\
    Still, there are a few improvements that can be made:\n\nThe <code>unit</code>\
    \ function is already defined in Racket, so there's no need to write it again;\
    \ you can use the <code>unit</code> procedure to simplify your code.\nThe <code>product</code>\
    \ function is unnecessary, so it can be removed.\nSince the <code>multiply</code>\
    \ function is a one-liner, it's better to use a lambda instead.\nThe arguments\
    \ are not being used, so it's better to use <code>_</code> instead.\n\nWith all\
    \ these changes the code becomes:\n<code>#lang racket\n", "  (displayln a)\n \
    \ (displayln b)\n  (let ((a (remainder a 10))\n        (b (remainder b 10)))\n\
    \    (displayln a)\n    (displayln b)\n    (* a b)))", '  (* (- a (* a (quotient
    a 10))) (- b (* b (quotient b 10)))))', "  (define (digits n)\n    (regexp-match?\

    \        (get-unit (* a b)))))\n</code>\nI'm checking whether either of the two\
    \ numbers are 0 - if either of them are, then I return 0. However, my tests seem\
    \ to indicate that this isn't being evaluated correctly. Are there any suggestions\
    \ or better ways of doing this in Racket?\n\n\nA:\n\nI think this is what you\

    \ I'm not sure why that's happening. I think the problem lies in the way I'm calling\
    \ <code>modulo</code>.\n\n\nA:\n\nThe trick is that <code>modulo</code> is the\
    \ remainder of dividing by ten, but you want the unit digit of the product.  You\
    \ could convert both numbers to strings, take the last character of each, convert\
    \ them to integers, multiply, and take the last character again, but that's a\
    \ lot of work.  As an alternative, you can use the definition of <code>modulo</code>\
    \ to do it:\n<code>(modulo (- x (* 10 (quotient x 10))) 10)\n</code>\nIf you remove\
    \ the unit digit from <code>x</code>, you can find the first digit of the product\
    \ by multiplying the two numbers and taking the modulus by ten.\n<code>(define\
