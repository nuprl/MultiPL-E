    How can I make this better?\n\n\nA:\n\nHere are a few suggestions, in no particular\
    \ order:\n\nYou are using <code>derivative</code> in your test cases. In <code>Racket</code>,\
    \ this can be confusing as there is a built-in function named <code>derivative</code>.\
    \ It might be best to rename your function to avoid conflicts.\nThis can be simplified\
    \ to a single <code>for/list</code> call. You can make use of the <code>map</code>\
    \ or <code>for/list</code> higher-order functions to transform each element. You\
    \ don't need to do this in two loops.\nYou can also use the <code>drop</code>\
    \ function to remove the leading zero.\n\n<code>#lang racket\n", "  (for/list\

    It's clear to me what the Python code does, but I'm having a hard time understanding\
    \ the Racket version. What does <code>build-list</code> and <code>list-ref</code>\
    \ do? What does <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> do? How do I know what parameters\
    \ go where?\n\n\nA:\n\nThis function is simply returning a list of the same length\
    \ as the original list, but with the items multiplied by the indices. The only\
    \ trickiness is that, because in Racket the first element of a list is index 0,\
    \ the first item in the output is omitted.\n<code>build-list</code> returns a\
    \ list of a given length with all the items computed by a function. It's a lot\
    \ like Python's <code>map</code> or <code>list</code> comprehensions.\n<code>list-ref</code>\
    \ (short for \"list reference\") returns the nth item of a list.\n<code>*</code>\
    \ is the multiplication operator. It just multiplies its arguments.\n<code>+</code>\
    \ is the addition operator. It just adds its arguments.\nSo, here's what the loop\
    \ is doing.\nIt starts with <code>i</code> set to 0. It checks the if statement,\
    \ which is false because 0 is not equal to 0. So, it returns to the top of the\
    \ loop with <code>i</code> set to 1.\nThe if statement is now true, so it moves\
    \ on to the body. It computes the value <code>(list-ref xs (+ i 1))</code>, which\
    \ is <code>(list-ref xs 2)</code>. This returns the third item of the list. It\
