    Is this code correct for all possible inputs? How can it be improved, if possible?\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nLike @Sylwester said in the comments, your code looks really good, except\
    \ for some minor details:\n\nProper code indentation: you should indent your code\
    \ using 2 spaces, and your outer <code>let</code> binding must be aligned with\
    \ the <code>define</code> that encloses it.\nPrefer <code>cond</code> over <code>if</code>\
    \ when the test returns a boolean: when you need to do an <code>if</code> statement,\
    \ use <code>cond</code> instead, it makes the code easier to read and less error-prone.\n\
    Use <code>if</code> only when it's necessary: this code is an example of a situation\
    \ where an <code>if</code> statement is not required, since the <code>below-zero-iter</code>\
    \ procedure will always return a boolean value, and you're comparing it to another\
    \ boolean, so you can just return it without the need for an <code>if</code>.\n\
    Prefer <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> over <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code>:\
    \ in Scheme, functions that access and modify the structure of pairs have short\
    \ names, like <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, while <code>first</code>\
    \ and <code>rest</code> are synonyms to <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>,\
    \ respectively, which you should use only when porting code from other languages\
    \ to Scheme.\n\nWith these details in mind, here's how your code should look like:\n\
    <code>(define (below-zero operations)\n  (define (below-zero-iter curr-sum operations)\n\

    </code>\nI also noticed a typo in your code, where you wrote <code>not (null?\
    \ operations)</code> instead of <code>(not (null? operations))</code>. I fixed\
    \ it in my code above.\nRegarding your question about <code>recur</code>; you\
    \ can't use it because it works only inside <code>loop</code> block. You can use\
    \ <code>recur</code> inside <code>loop</code> block to jump back to the beginning\
    \ of <code>loop</code> block, but you can't just use it without <code>loop</code>\
    \ block. It might be hard to understand this at first, but it makes sense when\
    \ you're writing a lot of <code>loop</code>-style loops instead of using recursion.\

    What is the correct answer?\n\n\nA:\n\nYou were very close, the problem is in\
    \ the part of the <code>iter</code> function where you're doing the recursion:\n\
    <code>(if (null? ops)\n</code>\nThe call to <code>null?</code> should be in the\
    \ <code>else</code> clause, because if the list is not empty you want to do the\
    \ recursion, and only if the list is empty you want to check if the account balance\
    \ is below zero. So the correct procedure would be:\n<code>(define (below_zero\
    \ operations)\n  (define (iter ops balance)\n    (if (null? ops)\n        (&lt;\
    \ balance 0)   ; &lt;-- just return the result\n        (let ([op (car ops)])\n\
    \          (iter (cdr ops) (+ balance op)))))\n  (iter operations 0))\n</code>\n\
    Alternatively, you can simplify your code and do it this way:\n<code>(define (below_zero\
    \ operations)\n  (define (iter ops balance)\n    (cond ((null? ops)   (&lt; balance\
    \ 0))\n          (else          (iter (cdr ops) (+ balance (car ops))))))\n  (iter\
