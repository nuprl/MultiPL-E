    \ the site interprets the comment as part of the program.  In Racket, <code>#lang</code>\
    \ is a comment, and while you're at it, you can also remove the space before the\
    \ first parenthesis.\nThe second way is to use <code>#reader</code> instead of\
    \ <code>#lang</code> and to make sure that it is the first word of the first line:\n\
    <code>#reader racket\n</code>\nAnd the third way is to use <code>#lang racket</code>\
