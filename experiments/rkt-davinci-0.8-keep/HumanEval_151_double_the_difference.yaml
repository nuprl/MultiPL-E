    \ etc.\nHow could I do the same thing but in a more DRY-er way? I thought about\
    \ using a <code>let</code> expression, but I am not sure that's better.\n\n\n\
    A:\n\nFirst, note that <code>let</code> expressions are not the only way to avoid\
    \ repeating expressions.  It is possible (and fairly easy) to use <code>letrec</code>\
    \ to define functions that do that instead.  These are known as <code>named let</code>\
    \ expressions, and are very common in functional programming.\nThat said, the\
    \ best way to avoid repeating one's self in this case is not to do so.  One should\
    \ avoid the repetition of logic, rather than the repetition of code.  This is\
    \ not always possible, and often the result is not very readable, but it is what\
    \ one should strive for.\nYour code, as it stands, contains two logical repetitions:\n\
    \nYou test if the <code>first</code> of the list is <code>integer?</code>, <code>positive?</code>,\
    \ and <code>odd?</code>.\nYou test if the list is <code>empty?</code>.\n\nBoth\
    \ of these are easily dealt with by writing a simple function.  In the first case,\
    \ one function that takes a number and returns true if it is an integer and positive\
    \ and odd:\n<code>(define (is-positive-odd-integer? n)\n  (and (integer? n)\n\
    \       (positive? n)\n       (odd? n)))\n</code>\nAnd in the second case, a function\
    \ that returns true if the list is empty:\n<code>(", "  (sum-of-squares (diff\

    \ (car lst)) (positive? (car lst)) (odd? (cadr lst)) (positive? (cadr lst)))</code>\
    \ but I keep getting the error \"application: not a procedure\".\n\n\nA:\n\nLet's\
    \ start with your code:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n  (if (empty?\
    \ lst)\n      0\n      (if (and (even? (car lst)) (odd? (cadr lst)))\n       \
    \   (+ (square (car lst)) (square (cadr lst)))\n          (double_the_difference\
    \ (cdr lst)))))\n</code>\nThe first problem is that <code>return</code> isn't\
    \ a function. Racket doesn't have a <code>return</code> statement, but if you\
    \ want to use it you'll have to <code>define</code> it as a function:\n<code>(define\
    \ (return x) x)\n</code>\nand then call it like any other function. However, using\
    \ <code>return</code> here is unnecessary because Scheme has a proper <code>if</code>\
    \ expression that returns a value, so you can simply write:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference\
    \ lst)\n  (if (empty? lst)\n      0\n      (if (and (even? (car lst)) (odd? (cadr\
    \ lst)))\n          (+ (square (car lst)) (square (cadr lst)))\n          (double_the",
  "  (foldl + 0\n         (map sqr\n              (filter even?\n                \
    \      (filter odd?\n                              (filter number?\n         \
    \                             (filter positive? lst)))))))\n</code>\nI was wondering\
    \ if there is a better way to do this in racket?\n\n\nA:\n\nThere are lots of\
    \ ways to improve this code, I'll try to list some of them here, just as an exercise.\
    \ First of all, the code is hard to read because it's too compact and it uses\
    \ too many parentheses.\nThe <code>filter</code> function expects a predicate\
    \ function as the first argument, and a list as the second argument. In this case\
    \ we are only using it to apply a predicate over a list and return the desired\
    \ elements. The <code>filter</code> function is meant to be used in conjunction\
    \ with lazy streams, that's why it's returning a stream, and also why it's named\
    \ <code>filter</code> instead of <code>filter-list</code> or something like that.\n\
    The <code>map</code> function expects a function as the first argument, and a\
    \ list as the second argument. In this case we're only using it to apply a function\
    \ to all the elements of a list and return a new list with the results. Again,\
    \ <code>map</code> is meant to be used in conjunction with lazy streams, but in\

    A:\n\nIn Scheme you may only have <code>cond</code> clauses that have a <code>predicate</code>/<code>condition</code>\

    What you're trying to do is implement a bunch of <code>if</code> statements, but\
    \ in Scheme (as in most functional languages) you don't use <code>if</code> -\
    \ you use <code>cond</code>.\nIf you are not familiar with the <code>cond</code>\

    What am I doing wrong?\n\n\nA:\n\nThe error message is telling you that, at some\
    \ point during the evaluation of the function, <code>car</code> is called with\
    \ a non-pair value. My best guess is that it's when the list is <code>'(0)</code>.\n\
    The problem is that you're using <code>empty?</code> when you really want to use\
    \ <code>null?</code>. <code>empty?</code> checks if the value is a list that has\
    \ no elements. <code>null?</code> checks if the value is <code>'()</code>, the\
    \ empty list. \nHere's a fixed version:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference\
    \ lst)\n  (cond [(null? lst) 0]\n        [else (cond [(positive? (integer? (car\
    \ lst)))\n                     (cond [(odd? (car lst)) (+ (square (car lst))\n\
    \                                                (double_the_difference (cdr lst)))]\n\
    \                           [else (double_the_difference (cdr lst))])]\n     \
    \              [else (double_the_difference (cdr lst))])]))\n</code>\nAlso, one\
    \ thing that would make this code a lot clearer is to break it into parts. For\
    \ example, you could make a helper function that checks if its argument is a positive\
    \ integer:\n<code>(define (positive-integer? n)\n  (and (positive? n) (integer?\
    \ n)))\n</code>\nThen you can rewrite your function like this:\n<code>(define\
    \ (double_the_difference lst)\n ", "  (if (null? lst)\n      0\n      (let ((a\
    \ (car lst))\n            (b (cadr lst)))\n        (if (and (integer? a)\n   \
    \              (&gt; a 0)\n                 (odd? a)\n                 (integer?\
    \ b)\n                 (&gt; b 0)\n                 (odd? b))\n            (*\
    \ a a a a b b b b)\n            0))))\n</code>\nThe result is correct, but the\
    \ code is an ugly mess. It seems that I have to repeat the condition many times.\
    \ How could I have avoid this? I tried using <code>filter</code> to filter out\
    \ the improper elements, but I don't know how to do that.\n\n\nA:\n\nSo you want\
    \ to sum the squares of the odd positive integers? Here's one way:\n<code>(define\
    \ (double-the-difference lst)\n  (apply + (map (\u03BB (x) (* x x x x))\n    \
    \            (filter (\u03BB (x) (and (integer? x) (&gt; x 0) (odd? x)))\n   \

    \ an invalid predicate, when you should simply use the <code>odd?</code> predicate.\
    \ The second issue is that you're calling the <code>square</code> procedure as\
    \ if it were a predicate, and after that you're calling the <code>double_the_difference</code>\
    \ procedure as if it were a predicate. The third and most important issue is that\
    \ you're not summing the values of the list recursively. Let's fix all these problems:\n\
    <code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n  (if (empty? lst)\n      0\n     \
    \ (+ (square (car lst))  ; &lt;-- this is how we should write the sum recursively\n\
    \         (double_the_difference (cdr lst)))))\n</code>\nThis is the idea, but\
    \ it doesn't work as intended yet. It's because we're not checking for odd numbers,\
    \ we're simply taking all the numbers from the list and computing the sum of their\
    \ squares. So let's fix that:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n  (if\
    \ (empty? lst)\n      0\n      (if (odd? (car lst))  ; &lt;-- check for odd numbers\n\

    \ is not odd we ignore it, but we continue with the recursion over the rest of\

    \ is not functional: you're modifying the value of the <code>lst</code> argument\
    \ at each call to <code>double_the_difference</code>. Instead, use <code>cond</code>\
    \ with the template I provided in my comment, it'll work much better.\nThen you\
    \ can use the <code>foldl</code> function to make it more elegant, like this:\n\
    <code>(define (double-the-difference lst)\n  (foldl + 0\n         (map (lambda\
    \ (num) (if (and (even? num) (positive? num))\n                              \

    <code>foldl</code> accepts a function, an initial value and a list, and returns\
    \ the result of applying the function to the initial value and the first element\
    \ of the list, then the result of that and the second element, and so on. And\

    \ - but you're not making any use of <code>n</code> except in the recursive call.\
    \ You could just as well pass <code>first</code> directly to the recursive call:\n\
    <code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n  (if (empty? lst)\n      0\n     \
    \ (let ([next (double_the_difference (rest lst))])\n        (if (and (integer?\

    \           next))))\n</code>\nAnother improvement is to use the form <code>(let\
    \ ([var1 (ex1)]) (ex2))</code> as a shortcut for <code>(let ([var1 (ex1)]) (let\
    \ ([var2 (ex2)]) body))</code>, so that you can extract the result of the recursive\
    \ call to <code>double_the_difference</code> directly into <code>next</code> rather\
    \ than in a separate <code>let</code> expression:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference\

    \ first version a bit more like this:\n<code>(define (double-the-difference lst)\n\
    \  (foldl + 0\n         (map square\n              (filter integer?\n        \

    \ to sum up all the values instead of <code>apply +</code>. <code>apply</code>\
    \ is a very general tool, used to call procedures with a varying number of arguments,\
    \ so it is not the right tool for simple tasks like summing up a list of numbers.\
    \ In fact, <code>apply</code> is rarely needed in Racket, and you can almost always\
    \ find a better way to write your code.\nBut if you were to ask what is the best\
    \ way to write this code, I'd say that it would be to rewrite the problem:\n<code>(define\
    \ (double-the-difference lst)\n  (foldl + 0\n         (map (\u03BB (x) (expt x\
    \ 2))\n              (filter even? lst))))\n</code>\nIn this solution we're using\
    \ <code>expt</code> instead of <code>square</code>, which is a small and irrelevant\
    \ change, but more importantly we're using <code>even?</code> instead of <code>integer?</code>\
    \ and <code>positive?</code>, which gives us a much more concise definition.\n\
    And it turns out that the two definitions are actually equivalent, because <code>even?</code>\
    \ is already defined as <code>(\u03BB (x) (and (integer? x) (positive? x)))</code>.\
    \ So it's actually possible to write the definition even more concisely:\n<code>(define\
    \ (double-the-difference lst)\n  (foldl + 0", "  (sum\n   (map (lambda (n) (*\
    \ n n))\n        (filter odd? lst))))\n", "  (let-values ([(odd-squares) (filter\
