    \ is what I did:\n1) I made a function <code>freq-of-elem</code> that counts the\

    \ which checks if the condition is satisfied by the first element. If not, it\
    \ recursively calls itself on the tail of the list.\nI'm not satisfied with the\
    \ code as it looks very clunky to me, can someone point me in the right direction?\
    \ Thanks!\n\n\nA:\n\nThe main problem with your solution is that you're recompute\
    \ the frequencies for each element of the list. But you're already computing them!\
    \ Just store the frequencies in a hash table, that way you'll only have to iterate\
    \ through the list once, not once for each element. Once you've stored the frequencies\
    \ in a hash table, you can use it to access the value for each element in constant\
    \ time (\\$O(1)\\$).\nThat's a much more efficient solution, but we can still\
    \ improve it, by using <code>for/fold</code> to iterate and accumulate the frequencies,\
    \ using <code>hash</code> to store them, and by using an <code>if</code> expression\

    I've tried wrapping it with <code>(make-dictionary)</code> to create a dictionary\
    \ but this didn't help.\n\n\nA:\n\nThe error doesn't mean that you should make\
    \ a dictionary.  It means that <code>dic</code> is not a dictionary.  It is an\
    \ object of type <code>dictionary-db</code>, which is a concrete implementation\
    \ of dictionaries.  It is not a dictionary itself.\nThe problem is that you don't\
    \ have a base case for <code>helper</code>.  You need a way to keep track of the\
    \ numbers you have seen so far.  If you are looking for the maximum you have seen,\
    \ then you need to carry that around.  If you have seen a number and its frequency,\
    \ then you have all the information you need to decide whether to return that\
    \ number.\nThat means that your base case should be when you get to the end of\
    \ the list and you have seen a number that passes the test.  If you have not seen\
    \ a number that passes the test, then you return <code>-1</code>.\nIf you do that,\
    \ you should find the second clause of your <code>cond</code> is always reached.\
    \  You need an extra clause that starts the process.\nYou also need to fix <code>&gt;=</code>\
    \ in your second clause.  It should read\n<code>(d", "  (letrec ([min-greater-than-freq\
    \ (lambda (lst freq)\n                                    (if (null? lst)\n  \

    \           (min-greater-than-freq (cdr lst) freq))))])\n    (min-greater-than-freq\
    \ lst 0)))\n</code>\nBut in the second case it's too slow. For some bigger lists\
    \ it takes so long that it crashes.\n\n\nA:\n\nI'd use <code>hash</code> for this\
    \ problem:\n<code>(define (search lst)\n  (let ((freq (hash))\n        (min (fold\

    \      (if (&gt;= (hash-ref freq i 0) i) i result))))\n</code>\nThis is not really\
    \ that much more code than what you wrote, but it is a bit more idiomatic.\nYou\
    \ need to use <code>for/fold</code> because <code>for-each</code> is not allowed\
    \ to change the variable the loop is bound to.  Also, note that the way <code>for-each</code>\
    \ is used here is to count the frequency of each element, which is more straightforward\
    \ than counting the frequency of each value up to the max element (and remembering\
    \ how many times the last one occurs).\nThe most important difference is that\
    \ it is O(N) in time and space (where N is the length of the list) instead of\

    \ the frequency of each number in a separate function and then use a more efficient\
    \ data structure like hash table:\n<code>(define (search lst)\n  (let* ([freq\
    \ (hash-table-from-alist \n                (map (lambda (x) \n               \

    \             (= (hash-table-ref freq key 0) key))\n                         \
    \   freq)))\n</code>\nI'd also put the <code>length</code> call in a separate\
    \ function, just for readability:\n<code>(define (count-matches lst n)\n  (length\
    \ (filter (lambda (y) (= n y)) lst)))\n</code>\nThis way the <code>count-matches</code>\
    \ function can be used in many other scenarios, and your solution becomes:\n<code>(define\
    \ (search lst)\n  (let* ([freq (hash-table-from-alist \n                (map (lambda\
    \ (x) \n                       (cons x (count-matches lst x)))\n             \
    \        lst))])\n    (hash-table-filter-keys (lambda (key)\n                \

    \ number in a separate function and then use <code>filter</code> with a lambda\
    \ function as in your original solution. This would be slower, but the program\
