    \ a programmatic solution to the above question.  However, the coding interview\
    \ demands that the candidate provide a simple, non-programmatic solution to the\
    \ question.  The simple, non-programmatic solution to the question requires you\
    \ to draw a picture.  Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long\
    \ line.  n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of\
    \ n cars are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very\
    \ far from each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to\
    \ collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right\
    \ to left.  However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they\
    \ continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.  Draw the cars\
    \ with a pencil on a piece of paper.  Put the pencil down.  Now, you will see\
    \ that the number of collisions is equal to half the number of cars.  This is\
    \ the correct answer.\nNow, the issue is that I don't know how to draw a picture\
    \ on a piece of paper in Racket.  Does anyone know how to do this?\n\n\nA:\n\n\

    \ a while since I touched this problem so I am sorry if the solution is incorrect.\n\
    This solution is related to the <code>nth triangle number</code>. \ne.g. nth triangle\
    \ number of 3 is <code>1 + 2 + 3 = 6</code>\n<code>n = 2\nleft to right - 1, 2\n\
    right to left - 2, 1\nno collision\n\nn = 3\nleft to right - 1, 2, 3\nright to\
    \ left - 3, 2, 1\ncollision! (1, 3) and (2, 2)\n</code>\n\nA different approach\
    \ I thought is to consider the two sequences and their sum. If a number occurs\
    \ an odd number of times, it means there are collisions and so we add one to the\
    \ running total.\nThis is the pseudo code.\n<code>\nfunc car_race_collision(n):\n\
    \    var left_to_right = 1..n\n    var right_to_left = n..1\n    var collide =\
    \ 0\n    for i = 1 to n:\n        for j = 1 to n:\n            if i + j is odd:\n\
    \                collide++\n    return collide\n</code>\nThe time complexity of\
    \ this is <code>O(n^2)</code> which is worse than <code>O(n)</code> for the previous\
    \ one.\n\n\nA:\n\nThere is one car moving left to right, and one moving right\
    \ to left.\nWe know that the sum of all the cars moving left to right is equal\
    \ to the sum of all the cars moving right to left:\n<code>car_race_collision(5)\n\
    \nleft to right - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nright to left - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\n1 + 2 + 3 +\
    \ 4 + 5 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1\n</code>\nIf we look at the sum, we can conclude that\
    \ for every two even numbers that sum up to an odd number, a collision must have\
    \ happened.\nSo how many times does this\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval)\

    Your algorithm compares the positions of cars. So lets count the number of comparisons.\n\

    \ \nIt runs in O(n^2) time. \nI thought this problem can be solved in O(nLogn)\
    \ time.\nAs an input, the cars can be represented as two integer arrays of size\
    \ n - the first array containing the position of the left-to-right cars and the\
    \ second array containing the position of the right-to-left cars.\nFor example,\
    \ this is how the cars would look like before moving:\n<code>3 cars moving left\
    \ to right: [0, 1, 2]\n3 cars moving right to left: [100, 101, 102]\n</code>\n\
    And this is how the cars would look like after moving:\n<code>3 cars moving left\
    \ to right: [1, 2, 3]\n3 cars moving right to left: [99, 100, 101]\n</code>\n\
    The solution would then iterate through the cars of the left-to-right cars and\
    \ for each one of them would use a binary search to find the left-to-right car\
    \ that is closest to it from the right-to-left cars. If the car is found, that\
    \ means a collision has occurred.\nI haven't found a way to use the binary search\
    \ approach. Any ideas how can the problem be solved using a binary search approach?\n\

    Is this logic correct ? how can I improve it ?\n\n\nA:\n\n<code>(define (car_race_collision\
    \ n)\n  (if (null? n) 0\n      (+ n (car_race_collision (cdr n)))))\n</code>\n\
    The above code sums the numbers of all collisions.\nIf the n cars are following\
    \ each other in the order given in the list it returns the number of pairs with\
    \ index difference 1, which is n - 1.\nIf the n cars are following each other\
    \ in the reversed order given in the list, it also returns the number of pairs\
    \ with index difference 1, which is n - 1.\nIf the n cars are permutated into\
    \ the order not given in the list it returns the number of pairs with index difference\
    \ 1, which is the number of all pairs.\nIf the n cars are permutated into the\
    \ reversed order not given in the list it returns the number of pairs with index\
    \ difference -1, which is the number of all pairs.\nIt is not clear why the question\
    \ requires the cars to move in two directions. The following code returns the\
    \ number of all pairs:\n<code>(define (car_race_collision n)\n  (if (null? n)\
    \ 0\n      (+ (car_race_collision (cdr n))\n         (car_race_collision (cdr\
