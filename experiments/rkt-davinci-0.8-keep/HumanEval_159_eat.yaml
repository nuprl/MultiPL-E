    \ get input in the form of three numbers. The first is the number of carrots we've\
    \ already eaten, the second is the number of carrots we need to eat, and the third\
    \ is the number of carrots left in the world. If we need more carrots than are\
    \ left, we return a list where the first element is the number of carrots left\
    \ and the second element is zero. If not, we return a list where the first element\
    \ is the number of carrots eaten and the second element is the number of carrots\
    \ left in the world.\n\nUsing `let` makes it easy to calculate the `eaten` value.\
    \ Then we just need to check if we've eaten more carrots than were left. If so,\
    \ we return a list where the first element is the number of carrots left in the\
    \ world and the second element is zero. If not, we return a list where the first\
    \ element is the number of carrots eaten and the second element is the number\
    \ of carrots left in the world.\n\nI think I see where the problem is. The problem\
    \ statement says that we should return an array, but Racket doesn't have arrays.\
    \ We can return a vector, which will be mapped to a JavaScript array, but it's\
    \ probably not what they meant. Also, the function inputs and outputs are integers,\
    \ but Racket doesn't have integers. We can use `#:restrict-type` to restrict the\
    \ inputs to integers, but the outputs are still inexact numbers.\n\nI'll just\
    \ submit the code and see what happens.\n\n**Update:** I got a \"Wrong answer\"\
    \ error. I'll try fixing the obvious issues first.\n\n## Solution: JavaScript\n\

    \ (+ number remaining) 0)\n      (values (+ number need) (- remaining need))))\n\
    ```\n\nAnd I made a solution for this quiz with multiple languages.\n\n## Python\n\
    \n```python\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    if number + need > remaining:\n\
    \        return [number + remaining, 0]\n    else:\n        return [number + need,\
    \ remaining - need]\n```\n\n## Ruby\n\n```ruby\ndef eat(number, need, remaining)\n\
    \  if number + need > remaining\n    [number + remaining, 0]\n  else\n    [number\
    \ + need, remaining - need]\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## JavaScript\n\n```javascript\n\
    const eat = (number, need, remaining) =>\n  number + need > remaining ? [number\
    \ + remaining, 0] : [number + need, remaining - need];\n```\n\n## Racket\n\n```racket",
  "  (values (+ number need) (- remaining need)))\n", "  (if (< remaining need)\n\
    \      (list (+ number remaining) 0)\n      (list (+ number need) (- remaining\
    \ need))))\n", "  (cond\n    [(< number 0) (list number 0)]\n    [(> number 0)\
    \ (list (+ number need) (- remaining need))]\n    [(> remaining 0) (list (+ number\
    \ remaining) 0)]\n    [else (list 0 0)]))\n```\n\n```\n#lang racket\n", "  (if\
    \ (>= need remaining)\n      (list (+ number remaining) 0)\n      (list (+ number\
    \ need) (- remaining need))))\n```\n\nThis is a fairly simple problem, the first\
    \ condition checks if there is enough carrots to satisfy the needs. This would\
    \ be a simple if statement in most languages, and in Racket, it is often better\
    \ to use `cond` instead of `if`.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn order to test this, I created\
    \ a simple 3-4 lines of code that test the first condition to see if it is working.\
    \ I tested it with numbers that are too small and too big.\n\n```racket", "  (define\

    \ do it.\n- Our programs will be simpler, but they will be harder to follow.\n\
    - We need to take advantage of the syntax to make our programs more readable.\n\
    \n- We will be using `racket` because it's easy to use in a web browser.\n\n-\
    \ To run the Racket code, you need to change the language to `Racket` and click\

    </code>\nThe reason that I have three cases is that the <code>number</code> of\
    \ carrots eaten in the past could be larger, smaller, or equal to the <code>need</code>\
    \ for the day's meals.\nThe first case (if <code>number</code> is greater than\
    \ <code>need + remaining</code>) is a special case where the number of carrots\
    \ eaten would be absurdly large, so I just return <code>(0 0)</code> instead.\n\
    Otherwise, I consider the three cases of <code>number</code> being greater than,\
    \ equal to, or less than <code>need</code>.\nIn the first two of those cases,\
    \ if <code>need</code> is greater than <code>remaining</code>, I return a list\
    \ of the number of carrots eaten and how many are left.\nOtherwise, I return a\
    \ list of how many carrots remain and how many carrots were eaten.\nIn the last\
    \ case (where <code>number</code> is less than <code>need</code>), if <code>number</code>\
    \ is greater than <code>remaining</code>, I return a list of <code>remaining</code>\
    \ followed by <code>remaining</code>.\nOtherwise, I return a list of <code>number</code>\
    \ followed by <code>remaining</code>.\n", "  (list (+ number need)\n        (if\
