prompt: "# You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single\

  \ a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, \n# and all\
  \ buckets have the same capacity.\n# Your task is to use the buckets to empty the\
  \ wells.\n# Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.\n# Example\
  \ 1:\n# >>> max_fill(list(list(0, 0, 1, 0), list(0, 1, 0, 0), list(1, 1, 1, 1)),\
