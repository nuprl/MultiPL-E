    \ each consisting of a single string. Your words_string() function takes one argument,\
    \ a list of strings. You're confusing two concepts. \nThe first one is a Perl\
    \ array. An array is an ordered collection of objects. In this case, an array\
    \ consists of scalars. Scalars are scalars. What you're passing to the words_string()\
    \ function is a list of strings. \nThe second concept is that of functions. Functions\
    \ take arguments and return values. The words_string() function takes no arguments,\
    \ so it has no return value. \nWhat you're trying to do is to pass an argument\
    \ to the words_string() function when it's called and have it return the array\
    \ containing the strings. \nTo do this you need to split your input into an array\
    \ of strings. Your input appears to be separated by lines, so you'll need to split\
    \ the input on newline characters.\n<code>\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;", "   \

    return join ', ', split /,/, $s;\n</code>\nThe tr/A-Za-z //d replaces anything\

    <|/ a dscore=1 tags=arrays,perl,string,subroutine |>\n<| c |>\nNice solution,\
    \ but please note that using `\\W` to match punctuation characters is not portable.\
    \ For example, `\\W` matches `?`, `$`, `^`, `-`, `_`, `~`, `+`, `*` and `&` in\
    \ `^[a-z]+\\W$`, which would break the regex if run on Windows (if those characters\
    \ were in the input string).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, thanks for the feedback. I\
    \ added a note. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, but what does `s/^\\s//;` do? :) Also,\
    \ I think it would be better to use `s{^\\s*}{}` instead of `s{^\\s*}`.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\n, that is a great suggestion, and is much simpler to use :) I originally\
    \ was using the `\\s` specifier in a more complicated regex and it was causing\
    \ problems.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=arrays,perl,string,subroutine |>\n<code>\n$string\
