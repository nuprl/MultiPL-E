    \ of `//` in the pattern, and delete all characters from the pattern.  If you\
    \ do `tr///cd` on `\"aeiouy\"`, then it will delete all occurrences of `y`.  This\
    \ is because the third `y` in the pattern will be left in the result, so it will\
    \ be deleted by the second `y` from the pattern.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis solution\

    `tr///cd` works perfectly on words with \"e\" at the end (ex: test).  It just\
    \ leaves a `y` behind.  If you do `tr//cd` on `\"test\"` then `\"t\"` gets removed,\
    \ but `\"est\"` stays.  So `tr///cd` works great for counting vowels at the end\
    \ of the word.  (This doesn't count words with \"e\" at the end, which is what\
    \ the OP asked for.)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis doesn't work as well, for example\

    Thanks for your answer. Just to clarify, the OP's question was about the speed\
    \ of algorithms, not how to write efficient code or how to use the language. I'm\
    \ guessing the OP wants to know if there's a faster algorithm or if he can improve\
    \ his code in other ways before he starts writing code with it.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ a |>\nI would not worry too much about performance in such a case because these\
    \ are really just simple exercises. If you really wanted to speed this up then\
    \ you would have to measure which method is the fastest and use that.\nHowever,\
    \ I would say that if you write an algorithm and then profile it you would find\
    \ that it is the bottleneck before you even start worrying about this kind of\
    \ thing. Because the speed of algorithms depend on a lot of things (like how fast\
    \ they get reordered because of cache misses). \nI wrote a really simple algorithm\

    \ let's start with a reminder that Perl regex operates by translating the regex\
    \ into a series of \"opcodes\" which are then executed. The first opcode searches\
    \ for a match beginning at the current position and moving forward to the end\
    \ of the string. The subsequent opcodes are used to manipulate the string found\
    \ from that point forward. Here's a breakdown of what happens:\n<code>\nuse re\
    \ 'debug';\nmy $str = 'abccc';\n$str =~ /a/;\nprint \"Position is: $-[0], Match\
    \ is: '$&'\\n\";\n$str =~ /a/;\nprint \"Position is: $-[0], Match is: '$&'\\n\"\
    ;\n$str =~ /a/;\nprint \"Position is: $-[0], Match is: '$&'\\n\";\n$str =~ /a/;\n\
    print \"Position is: $-[0], Match is: '$&'\\n\";\n$str =~ /a/;\nprint \"Position\
    \ is: $-[0], Match is: '$&'\\n\";\n$str =~ /a/;\nprint \"Position is: $-[0], Match\
    \ is: '$&'\\n\";\n$str =~ /a/;\nprint \"Position is: $-[0], Match is: '$&'\\n\"\
    ;\n</code>\nOutput:\n<code>\nPosition is: 1, Match is: 'a'\nPosition is: 3, Match\
    \ is: 'a'\nPosition is: 3, Match is: 'a'\nPosition is: 2, Match is: 'a'\nPosition\
    \ is: 3, Match is: 'a'\nPosition is: 3, Match is: 'a'\n</code>\nNow let's look\
    \ at what happens inside the /a block. It starts at the current position (1) and\
    \ goes forward to position 3. It does so by going up one character at a time until\
    \ it finds a match.\nThe first match is found at the end of the string, so the\
    \ second opcode is executed. Now let's look at the next block:\n<code>\n$str =~\
    \ /a/;\nprint \"Position is: $-[0], Match is: '$&'\\n\";\n</code>\nHere ", " \
