    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThis works perfectly on every test case that I tried except for\
    \ 1 that I need to sort and it doesn't work. The test case is as follows: \nInput:\

    \ I understand why it isn't working. The problem is that when there are two pairs\
    \ that share the same value but are divisible by 3, it just puts one of those\
    \ pairs in the third position. So for the array 2 4 6 1 3 it sorts the array by\
    \ putting 1 6 4 2 3 into index 3, but then it also puts 1 6 4 3 2 in index 1,\
    \ which would not be allowed. My solution works because it only sorts the list\
    \ by putting values into third position if there are three or more of those values\
    \ in the list.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=perl,arrays,sorting |>\n<code>\nuse strict;\n\

    `@array` doesn't contain anything after `sort` returns, so why use `@array` afterwards\

    \ Note that `$a = *foo()` will make a copy of whatever the subroutine returns\
