    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI've edited my original post (last time I posted it, I didn't\

    \ c |>\n<| c |>\n, your algorithm is correct. I just checked it again. I had a\

    \ I have updated the script and example in the answer. As far as the `sub will_it_fly`\
    \ function goes, that script is just one possible implementation of a solution.\
    \ There are many other ways to optimize it. You can do `will_it_fly($w, [@$q])`\

    \ |>\n<| a |>\nThe problem is probably that you haven't yet learned about \"functional\
    \ programming\".  This is a very good thing because \"functional programming\"\
    \ is the way that programmers write programs that can benefit from being written\
    \ in functional style (like map and reduce are written in functional style). \
    \ You might want to read about this concept to get some ideas about how to approach\
    \ the problem.\nSo now the problem is how to write code which can benefit from\
    \ being written in functional style.  One way is to use functional programming\
    \ in a way that makes it easy to apply functional techniques to data structures\
    \ that you think are easier to manipulate (such as arrays and hash tables).  You\
    \ can see this by thinking about how you would solve this problem if you were\
    \ writing in \"procedural\" style.  For example, you might start with a set of\
    \ palindrome pairs and then remove them from the set by looping through them.\
    \  Now you could write a loop that removed the palindrome pairs from the array\
    \ and added them to a new array but that would probably be more difficult to read\
    \ and therefore hard to maintain.\nSo let's suppose that you have a data structure\
    \ which you want to manipulate in such a way that it's easy to manipulate and\
    \ apply functional techniques to it.  You might start with using reduce to group\
    \ the elements of the data structure into sets of palindrome pairs.  Then you\
    \ would use map to apply your test function to every pair in the group.  Then\
    \ you use reduce to combine all the sets of palindrome pairs into a new set. \
