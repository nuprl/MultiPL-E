    This is not an exact answer to your question, but I was struggling to come up\
    \ with a simple method for the same problem. I also looked into using the sieve\
    \ of Eratosthenes but that just did not work for me. So, here is a simpler method\
    \ which worked for me. You can simply calculate the primes upto N and find the\
    \ factors of the number:\n<code>\nfrom math import sqrt\ndef factorize(N):\n \
    \   primes = []\n    for i in range(2,int(sqrt(N)+1)):\n        if N % i == 0:\n\
    \            primes.append(i)\n    return primes\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=5 |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThis is wrong. The first prime number is `3`, and your algorithm returns\
    \ `3` as the factor (rather than `[2,3]`).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis does not work\
    \ when the number to be factorized is not prime (try factorize(16)). The factor\
    \ is `[2, 2]` instead of `[2,3]`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: It is not wrong, since\
    \ `3` is also a prime factor.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAgreed.  `3` isn't returned\
    \ because it's not divisible by `3`.  But if `3` was a factor, then your algorithm\
    \ would return `[2,3]` because `3` is also a factor.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes this\
    \ doesn't work. It only \nuse Test::Deep;\n\n\nsub testhumaneval {\n    my $candidate\

    \ tested it and it does work. But it's definitely not the fastest way possible,\
    \ especially since it doesn't use memoization (which is pretty slow). I wonder\
    \ if someone can come up with a faster way...\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: memoization\
    \ is usually fast enough, since the memory is shared between processes, and thus\
    \ shared between different processes in the same machine. Since you're using memoization,\
    \ you're probably also using shared memory (which is slow enough). Anyway, memoization\
    \ is rarely faster than a simple O(N^2) algorithm: it's usually the opposite.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou are correct, it is not the fastest way possible, but it\
    \ is simpler and easier to write (IMHO). And it's usually the best way (in my\
    \ experience, anyway).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I wrote a program that does this\
    \ in C and used pthreads to get speed comparisons.  I used a recursive algorithm\
    \ with a memoization array and compared it to my naive algorithm in Python.  It's\
    \ pretty clearly the recursive way is going to be faster, and as others have pointed\
    \ out, it's usually the most straight-forward and easy to write way to solve a\
    \ problem.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI did an update of my code to show that the recursive\
    \ way is the winner. Thank you for pointing out the obvious. I still do have a\
