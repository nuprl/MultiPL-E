    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for this answer!  I have spent the past couple of days\
    \ trying to understand the code you posted.  You rock!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks\
    \ for your contribution!  I was actually trying to solve this problem as part\
    \ of a challenge in my book.  I wanted to write it without using any loops or\
    \ recursion as I knew recursions were the most efficient way to do this.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| a tags=algorithm,string,perl,substring |>\nHere's a solution in Ruby:\n\
    <code>\ndef select_words(s, n)\n  (s.scan(/\\w+/) - ['']).map do |w|\n    w.size\
    \ % n == 0 ? w : nil\n  end.compact\nend\n</code>\nThe idea is to first remove\
    \ all words from the string that don't contain n consecutive consonants (i.e.\
    \ the empty string). Then map the remaining words to all their possible combinations\
    \ (i.e. the array of all combinations of letters present in the remaining word).\n\
    Finally, we filter out all empty combinations.\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| a dscore=2\
    \ |>\nHere is another solution in Perl that uses no loops or recursion.\n<code>\n\

    \ Also, the `@a` array should be cleared out before adding new words. Also, please\
    \ don't post answers in an answer thread, post them in a comment instead. Comments\
    \ are a better place for this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, I am not familiar with regex\
    \ and thought that using substr and length would help the OP.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\n`@a` is cleared out when a new word is found? Yes, but you also need the\
    \ `push` when a new word is found. The `@a` should be cleared out when a new word\
    \ is found because otherwise it could be unbounded as long as the string is not\
    \ empty.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, you are right about `push`. I just checked the\
    \ perldoc (http://www.perldoc.org/functions/push.html) on my machine and my perl\
    \ version is v5.18.2. So it is the correct way to use push. But it makes sense\
    \ to clear the array out as well. Edited the answer accordingly.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\n, Thanks for your answer. Yes I agree that regex is more efficient. I\
    \ will use it in future for sure. However this was a part of my interview question\
    \ and I was unable to solve it using regex. This was the only solution I came\
    \ across.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=string,perl |>\nThis approach is not as bad as\
    \ many people's solutions, as the regex is simple and efficient.\n<code>\nuse\

    \ that contain the n consonants. One issue with this is that it requires the string\
    \ to be sorted. If it's not, then you could find the length of the string in O(n)\
    \ time, and then sort the string in the required order, then find the n consonants\
    \ in O(n) time.\nThe idea for the second approach can be found in the following\
    \ code. It works out to find the length of the string in O(logn) time and sorts\
    \ the string in O(nlogn) time by swapping the character with the last one in the\
    \ string before it's sorted, and then finding the n consonants in O(n) time. \n\

    w a character class with a capturing group that contains only a single character\

    \ think what you have said is correct. `\\b` will match on the start and end of\

    \ will remove a sequence of whitespace at the start of the string, and that's\
    \ not really what the OP is asking.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Well, what he asked\
    \ for was _All words from string s that contain exactly n consonants_, which means\
    \ removing all whitespace from the beginning of a string and removing the empty\
    \ strings would not work. I agree, that may be not the best solution here.\n<|/\
