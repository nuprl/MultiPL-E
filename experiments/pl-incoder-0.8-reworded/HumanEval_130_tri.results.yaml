    \ does not return the tribonacci sequence for values `1` and `2`...\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYes it does, it's exactly the same code as I posted except for the second\
    \ `if` statement. It's just not very optimized.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, the second\
    \ `if` is exactly the same as the first, but it's much less efficient. In general,\
    \ when you are writing a function that works on numbers, it's best to write it\
    \ in a way that is as efficient as possible.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe first if\
    \ statement is the exact same as the second if statement except it's now written\
    \ in a different way. It takes exactly the same amount of time to execute but\
    \ the second if statement uses a loop with an if/else statement which means it's\
    \ less efficient (although the compiler could easily optimize it away since it\
    \ always executes the else branch).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe second if statement\
    \ is written in two places. The first if statement is written in a way that uses\
    \ one assignment statement in the loop while the second if statement is written\
    \ in a way that uses an if/else statement. In the second case it's less efficient\
    \ (although the compiler could easily optimize it away) to use a loop over a if/else\
    \ statement.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=math,c++,c dscore=2 |>\nI came up with this,\

    \ sequence is different from Fibonacci sequence: Tribonacci sequence goes `1 1\

    \ Good luck.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes it is recursive - but i was able to solve\

    \ is probably more straightforward and easier to understand.  It does have a slightly\
    \ higher memory consumption than some other solutions, but hopefully it's still\
    \ fairly efficient.\nThis solution uses the observation that you can recover an\
    \ nth number by choosing a number between 1 and 2 that gives you the desired proportion\
    \ of 1s.  This gives the following formula for nth number:\n<code>\ntri(n) = n\
    \ * (n + 1) / 2\n</code>\nIf you have n numbers, then the recovered nth number\
    \ is given by:\n<code>\ntri(n - 1)\n</code>\nThe first step is to build an array\
    \ of all the numbers in the range 0..(n-1). There are a number of ways to do this.\
    \  In this solution, I just used an array.  We can also build one from an array\
    \ of numbers in reverse order:\n<code>\nuse Test::Deep;\n\n\nsub testhumaneval\

    \ The reason is that `fib(n)` takes O(n) time but this function takes O(n) time\

    \ + tri(n) + tri(n + 1)`. Also, this algorithm takes time to compute `tri(n+1)`,\
    \ which makes it less efficient than it should be.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI guess\
    \ you're right. I was looking at the Wikipedia page, not the actual code. I think\
    \ a more efficient version would be: my($n) = @_; my @result = (); for my $i (0\

    \ 2 == 1; } return @result;\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: This answer is correct. `tri(n)\

    \ + 1)`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's still wrong. The correct answer is `1, 3, 6,\
    \ 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55`; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Relation_with_other_Fibonacci_sequences\
    \ for an explanation of why `tri(7)` is `1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55`.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Actually, the wikipedia article is wrong, too. The recursive\
    \ formula is `tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2)`, not `tri(n) = tri(n-2) + tri(n-1)`.\
    \ See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Relation_with_other_Fibonacci_sequences.\n\

    \ fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=5 |>\n<| c |>\nYou missed the\

    \ work for the general case; you need the function call `tri($n-1)` in both branches\
    \ (and similarly for `tri($n-2)` and `tri($n+1)`).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou are\
    \ right. Thanks for your comment. I corrected my answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2\
    \ |>\nMy answer is similar to Jason's, but I did some more analysis so I thought\
    \ I'd add my analysis.\nThe recursive definition of tri uses tri twice. One to\
    \ calculate the tri sequence up to n, and then another time to calculate the tri\
    \ sequence up to n + 1.\nIf you're a math whiz like me, the tri sequence looks\
    \ like the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where n gets bigger than 3 since\
    \ there are n +1 terms, but then there are 3 terms, so I find it hard to see how\
    \ this helps us get the n+1 terms. \nIf you take a closer look at the Fibonacci\
    \ sequence, you can see that the base case stops there since it's always 1 2 3.\
    \ And then it goes up from there in base 3, like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on\
    \ and so forth.\nLet's look at tri again. The base case is simple. Tri sequences\
    \ stop at n=0 and n=1. So, it looks like the Fibonacci sequence. But we want the\
    \ n+1 terms, so we need to keep tri around forever. The base case for tri also\
    \ happens to stop at n=2. So, it looks like the Fibonacci sequence. But it continues\
    \ around for the n+1 terms. So, how are these two different? Well, for the base\
    \ case, we always have to return the sequence up to the base case (or the n terms).\
    \ So, we need to keep our results around as we go through the sequence. Think\
    \ of the Fibonacci \nuse Test::Deep;\n\n\nsub testhumaneval {\n    my $candidate\
