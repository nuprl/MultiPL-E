    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI asked this question as a learning exercise, not a production\
    \ implementation. :-)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat's a pretty nifty solution. Do you\
    \ know if there is any performance difference between the different methods, or\
    \ is this all just as fast as `tr`?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I thought this was a\
    \ good question! I didn't know Perl had regex capabilities built in! Nice answer,\
    \ by the way, +1.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Not sure how you came up with your method\
    \ (which is really the fastest I came up with), but I just did some testing and\
    \ was surprised to find this out: on my system (a Linux machine), this was twice\
    \ as fast as `tr`. See my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/939420/how-many-distinct-characters-in-a-given-string-case-aware/939477#939477\n\

    \ every single character in the alphabet, which returns a list of all the distinct\
    \ characters found in the string.  Then we simply return how many of those distinct\
    \ characters there are in the string.\nI chose to split the alphabet into an array\
    \ and loop through it each time we were looking for distinct characters to avoid\
    \ having to create another regular expression that would be very expensive (although\
    \ this is only a couple of additional lines of code).\n<|/ a dscore=4 |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nThis will not work properly if there are spaces in the string.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n: Yes, of course it will not work properly if there are spaces in the\
    \ string.  I mentioned that in my answer, and I explained why in the second paragraph.\
    \  The only way to handle spaces in a string is to split the string on every single\
    \ character, which would increase the time complexity of the function from O(n)\
    \ to O(n^2).\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe answer by will work, but if you're trying\
    \ to do this more than once, you're better off defining a constant that is a hash\
    \ set of characters. You can define one like this:\n<code>\nuse Hash::Util qw(string_hash);\n\
    my %unique = string_hash($string);\n</code>\nThen you can do this:\n<code>\n$unique{lc($char)}++;\n\
    </code>\nThis is far more efficient than a regex solution, because it'll only\
    \ do the hashing once rather than once per character.\nIf you need to do this\
    \ more than once, I'd suggest writing a small utility function like this:\n<code>\n\
