    Thanks for the explanation on why you chose to use `tr/a-z/A-Z/`. I had just read\

    \ use it one way or the other. I never would have guessed that.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\

    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nNot necessarily. I guess it is just because I like Perl better,\
    \ and I find it easier to reason about things in Perl instead of having to remember\
    \ how these things really work. I find it harder to believe that Perl is anything\
    \ more than a fancy regex engine, and that some things are just not possible or\
    \ very difficult to do without using regex tricks.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree\
    \ that Perl is *very* fancy, and I like Perl, but I still find the concept of\
    \ \"string manipulation\" to be confusing when there are multiple ways to do it.\
    \ So I don't mind Perl not having this nice trick, but I do find it frustrating\
    \ that they decided to make `tr` the only way to go, but forgot about `lc` or\
    \ `uc`, which could be the best way to go. But I guess it can be explained that\
    \ way.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, `tr` is one of the best ways to go about this.\
    \ I too find it frustrating that Perl's `tr` is so poorly designed and implemented\
    \ with limited functionality. Also, `tr` can do more than just replace individual\
    \ characters with something else. For example, `tr/a{2,4}z/y{2,4}z` will replace\
    \ all `a`s with `y`s and all `b`s with `z`s, even though `tr` can do that in a\
    \ single step. See [this](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/tr.html) for details.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=perl,regex |>\nIn order to count the number of distinct characters,\
    \ you don't need to count the number of characters at all. Just take the first\

    \ doing! This is really cool and actually works to solve the problem. I'll have\
    \ to figure out exactly how it works though. I've been trying to understand the\
    \ regex but I'm really not sure what it does exactly. Could you explain how the\
    \ regex works? I'm guessing it's basically splitting on the whitespaces and then\
    \ converting the lowercase to uppercase for the first and second elements. But\
    \ I can't really understand what the regex is doing exactly.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    - Added explanation. Hope it's clearer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, your regex is missing\
    \ a closing brace: `s/^(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)\\s+(.*)/\\1\\n\\2\\n\\3\\n/`\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=4 |>\nI was going to use perl, but I thought that maybe awk could\
    \ be used. Since I didn't want to use it, I did some more digging, and came up\
    \ with this:\n<code>\nawk '{print substr($0,length($0),1)}' file > file.new\n\
    </code>\nBasically, it finds the length of the string in the file, and removes\
    \ the first character.\nI got this from here: How can I remove the first character\
    \ in a string in bash?\n<|/ a tags=perl,regex |>\n<| c |>\nThis doesn't work if\
    \ you have an embedded newline in your string (like `$'string'`)\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\n- True, but that can be overcome with some more fiddling around with awk's\
    \ `RS` variable.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=3 tags=perl,regex |>\nThis might work\
    \ for you:\n<code>\n$str =~ s/^[^[:upper:]]//;\n</code>\nThe regex will find any\
    \ non-uppercase letters at the beginning of the string and remove them.\n<|/ a\
    \ |>\n<| a dscore=3 |>\nUsing pure Perl one can write it like this:\n<code>\n\

    <|/ a tags=perl,regex,string |>\n<| c |>\nPlease note the example in my answer\
    \ -- there were cases where it didn't work.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis works quite\
    \ well, but I haven't found a way of getting the correct counts for non-ascii\
    \ characters, i.e. characters that cannot be encoded with the ascii table. I've\
    \ tried `use utf8; uc $string;` and then `chr $string`, but that didn't seem to\
    \ help. Any ideas how this could be improved?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I suspect\
    \ that the problem is that your characters are actually multi-byte characters.\
    \  If so, your only option is to count characters in the *actual* UTF-8 encoding,\
    \ and not characters in any code point within the string.  There are a few modules\
    \ that can help you with this, but I prefer [Unicode::String](https://metacpan.org/pod/Unicode::String)\
    \ or [String::Normalize](https://metacpan.org/pod/String::Normalize).\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a tags=perl,regex,string dscore=2 |>\n<code>\nmy $str1 = 'AA BB CC';\nmy $str2\
    \ = 'BB CC';\nmy %hash = ();\nfor (split(/ /, $str1)) {\n    my $key = $_;\n \
    \   $hash{$key} += length($str2) =~ /$key/g;\n}\nprint \"$_ => $hash{$_}\\n\"\n\
    for sort {\n    $hash{$a} <=> $hash{$b}\n} keys %hash;\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nAh, this solution is probably the best one here (for speed). You don't\
    \ need to split the string, you can just use the `length()` function of the string\
    \ directly.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I see you are new to Stack Overflow. If you\
