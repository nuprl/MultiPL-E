    Thanks for the explanation on why you chose to use `tr/a-z/A-Z/`. I had just read\

    \ use it one way or the other. I never would have guessed that.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\

    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nNot necessarily. I guess it is just because I like Perl better,\
    \ and I find it easier to reason about things in Perl instead of having to remember\
    \ how these things really work. I find it harder to believe that Perl is anything\
    \ more than a fancy regex engine, and that some things are just not possible or\
    \ very difficult to do without using regex tricks.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree\
    \ that Perl is *very* fancy, and I like Perl, but I still find the concept of\
    \ \"string manipulation\" to be confusing when there are multiple ways to do it.\
    \ So I don't mind Perl not having this nice trick, but I do find it frustrating\
    \ that they decided to make `tr` the only way to go, but forgot about `lc` or\
    \ `uc`, which could be the best way to go. But I guess it can be explained that\
    \ way.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, `tr` is one of the best ways to go about this.\
    \ I too find it frustrating that Perl's `tr` is so poorly designed and implemented\
    \ with limited functionality. Also, `tr` can do more than just replace individual\
    \ characters with something else. For example, `tr/a{2,4}z/y{2,4}z` will replace\
    \ all `a`s with `y`s and all `b`s with `z`s, even though `tr` can do that in a\
    \ single step. See [this](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/tr.html) for details.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=perl,regex |>\nIn order to count the number of distinct characters,\
    \ you don't need to count the number of characters at all. Just take the first\
