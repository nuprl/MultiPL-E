    \ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for the help! I went with the first solution\
    \ (the one that uses two functions) since it does all of that in one line. Can\
    \ you explain a bit on how your solution works? I'm having trouble understanding\
    \ why you're using my encode function. I don't see how you can use the encode\
    \ function without having to call the encode function again.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The `encode` function simply replaces all letters with their uppercase forms,\
    \ and all vowels with 'E's.  Since vowels come before letters in the alphabet,\
    \ `encode` will find that 'aeiou' comes after 'A', and replace it with 'E's. \
    \ `AEIOUaeiou` would thus become `EEEEEEEE`, which will then be converted back\
    \ to uppercase `EWGEWGEWGE`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOhhhhh. Now it makes sense. So\
    \ it replaces the vowels with 'E's and also makes all letters uppercase. Makes\
    \ sense! Thank you for the explanation!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're welcome.  If\
    \ you found this answer helpful, please upvote.  If it solved your problem, please\
    \ mark it as the answer.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=perl,replace,string,regex dscore=0 |>\nI like using the Regexp::Assemble\
    \ module to build up regexps for repeated substitutions. You also can avoid repeating\
    \ a common prefix ([a-z]), a common suffix ($) and the common word ([aeiou]) in\

    \ |>\nI like to think of \"Perl regex\" as a \"black box\", that does some \"\
    magic\", and outputs the result.\nWhen you want to write a new regex, you have\
    \ to look carefully at what it is doing.\nPerl regexes are very similar to Perl\
    \ regexes, but they behave a bit differently.\nIn Perl, everything matches a particular\
    \ pattern.  If you want a regex that matches only letters, you write\n<code>\n\
    my $letter_only = qr/a-z/;\n</code>\nIf you want to match anything except whitespace,\
    \ you write\n<code>\nmy $non_whitespace = qr/[^ ]/;\n</code>\nIf I want to match\
    \ a line that ends with a letter followed by a number, or anything else that's\
    \ not whitespace or a digit, I write\n<code>\nmy $line_ends_with_letter = qr/[a-z0-9]+$/;\n\
    </code>\nIf you look carefully at the \"magic\" Perl regexes do, you'll notice\
    \ that they actually do different things.\nIn Perl, they have a lot of \"magic\"\
    .  They can match things by applying them to text in a very different way.\nI\
    \ actually have a book on Perl regexes, that goes into far more detail about each\
    \ of the patterns, and even shows how it works in detail.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I find that using perl's regular expressions make my code more readable. I know\
    \ that perl regex is similar to perl regex in some way, but it has a bit more\
    \ overhead than perl regex, so I find that my code is more readable using perl\

    \ to encode a string by replacing one letter at a time, but if you look at the\
    \ ASCII table (http://www.asciitable.com/), you see that there are only 26 capital\
    \ letters and 26 lower case letters. So you only need to replace one letter in\
    \ an even number, and the rest will be encoded correctly. \nFor example, the string\
    \ 'abcde', if you replace the first letter 'a', the string will be 'bcde', and\
    \ if you replace the second letter 'b', the string will be 'cde', and so on. Of\
    \ course, you will have to iterate over the string and replace each letter in\
    \ it. So your code is wrong for some reason.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThat's a good\
    \ point, I had a typo in my code (which I've edited to include). However, I'm\
    \ still having issues. I've changed the code so I can replace the letter with\
    \ its index number, but for some reason it's still giving me incorrect results.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nYou need to use character constants (ASCII codes rather than\
    \ strings):\n<code>\nuse Test::Deep;\n\n\nsub testhumaneval {\n    my $candidate\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI realise that the question was tagged \"Python\", but this answer\
    \ really isn't Python code. At least not as far as I can tell. Python has a `ucfirst`\
    \ function that takes a single string, but your code looks like it takes a subroutine\
    \ reference and applies it to every matching string. Which doesn't make sense\
    \ in Python.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree that your answer is Perl and not Python,\
    \ though my Perl and Python knowledge is limited.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you,\
    \ I've fixed it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n- What does it mean to apply a subroutine\
    \ reference to a string?  A subroutine reference is a scalar, just like the scalar\
    \ reference `'foo'` which is a string.  It's not an array.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    - In Perl, subroutine references are in fact scalars whose contents are a function\
    \ reference. So if you have a subroutine reference, you can apply it to strings\
    \ just by using the `&` operator. That's all it means to apply a subroutine reference\
    \ to a string.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nPython:\n<code>\ndef to_english(text):\n  \
