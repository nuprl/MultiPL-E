    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThe code looks great, but I don't think it works. For example:\
    \ `count_up_to(19)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`, but this only happens if the\
    \ number you are testing is prime. Otherwise, `$primes = count_up_to(19);` returns\
    \ `[]`, which isn't what OP expects.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI fixed the bug. `@primes`\
    \ should be sorted before `push`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`@primes` should be sorted\
    \ before `push` indeed, I thought you meant it to be sorted after `for` loop ends.\
    \ Sorry for that. Your implementation is much more elegant, though.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI'm still a bit confused, I understand the algorithm but I don't really\
    \ understand the implementation.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited my answer, hope\
    \ that helps. It's too long for a comment, so I wrote it as a new answer. You\
    \ may want to take a look at the documentation for `sort` (or just Google). The\
    \ first result is [here](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sort.html). Also, just\
    \ for giggles, I added a more efficient implementation that doesn't require the\

    \ with that first line. Also, your second point is wrong. You're testing if the\
    \ number is a prime _below_ `n`, not `n`, so you won't catch any numbers that\
    \ are divisible by 4.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nPlease see the code I added above to\

    \ I tested it and it returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]` when I put in `count_up_to(3)`.\
    \ However, when I put in `count_up_to(10)`, it returns `[2,3,5,7,11,13]`.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo, that's not correct. Read the function again, specifically\
    \ the part that says `if ($n % 2 != 0) { push(@primes, $n); }`. It does exactly\
    \ what you said it should. You're adding `n` to your array only when it's even.\
    \ Do you know how `push` works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=primes,math,algorithm,perl\
    \ |>\nThe main problem with this algorithm is that it will take a long time to\
    \ execute (even for small numbers). You need some way to eliminate numbers which\
    \ aren't prime, otherwise you will just be repeating numbers you already know.\n\
    One way to eliminate numbers from an array is to use a prime number sieve. One\
    \ of the most efficient sieves is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which can be efficiently\
    \ implemented using a hash and bit operations.\nHere is a Perl implementation:\n\
