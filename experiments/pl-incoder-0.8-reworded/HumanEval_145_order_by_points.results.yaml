    The downside of the naive approach is that it will sort integers in unexpected\
    \ ways. You don't want it to sort `123` before `456`, do you? That's a natural\
    \ order, but it's not what we expect when looking at sums.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Agreed. An ordering that is consistent with the way sums are sorted is a good\
    \ idea. I\u2019m not quite sure what ordering would be ideal in that case though.\
    \ My point was that if someone wants to sort by point value, they might prefer\
    \ to leave out the \u201Cpoints\u201D and sort on only the sums.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nI guess a solution would be to sort by sum first, then by point value,\
    \ like in this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26646171/how-to-sort-array-of-objects-by-two-attributes).\
    \ But that requires me to create two arrays, sort them, and then recombine them.\n\

    \ part that is hard to understand is the for loop. In the first part, we create\
    \ a hash (%hash) from all the numbers in array. Then we sort the keys of that\
    \ hash in ascending order. Then we iterate through the keys and assign the value\
    \ of the key to the index of the number in array. Then we replace the number with\
    \ the index.\n<code>\n$hash{ $num } = $num;\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThanks,\
    \ that is a great explanation. Can you please explain how it works since I am\
    \ a novice?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSure. I've added the explanation to the answer.\
    \ Tell me if you need more explanation.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis code does not\
    \ work. If there is no number in the original list with the biggest value, it\
    \ will return `@$nums` as it is. This should be fixed by checking if the number\
    \ of items in the array is greater than zero before sorting. Also, if you have\
    \ only one number in the array, you can leave out the `if` statement and just\
    \ sort it as it is.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI didn't have time to debug it. I've just\
    \ fixed it now. Thanks for pointing it out.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nI would\
    \ do it like this:\n<code>\nuse Test::Deep;\n\n\nsub testhumaneval {\n    my $candidate\

    \ think of is that it's easier to keep track of which elements have been sorted\
    \ (since you already have their indices), than to keep track of which ones have\
    \ already been sorted (since you need the original order).  But I'm not sure how\
    \ to do that since it's hard to keep track of multiple elements at once while\
    \ you're sorting...\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: It should also be a lot more efficient\
    \ since it only needs to keep track of the sums of digits of the array elements\

    \ the sums of the digits of the array elements and not of the original array elements\

    \ see.  Yeah, I think you're right that it's better to keep the original order\
    \ and only sort the digits of the original array.  I think your solution will\
    \ still work (though it will take a little more code), I just think your solution\
    \ will be faster.  I guess my original solution was just slower.  I like your\
    \ idea of keeping track of the original order, so I might implement that too,\

    \ For example for `[ 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1 ]` it gives `[ 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1,\
    \ -1 ]`. The correct output should be `[ 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1 ]`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI edited the answer so it works on all input cases. I added another example\
    \ to show that it is working.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks a lot. It works now.\
    \ However can you please explain me how it works? Why are we checking for the\
    \ carry in the first map loop?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`map {...}` is a function which\
    \ takes a list (or array) of numbers and returns a list (or array) of numbers\
    \ which are the result of applying `...` to each number. `map {$carry || $a->[0]\
    \ <= $b->[0] ? $a->[0] : $b->[0]}` is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns\
    \ the smaller one. Since `$carry || $a->[0] <= $b->[0]` is the same as `$carry\
    \ ? $a->[0] : $b->[0]` it basically means \"return `a->[0]` if `$carry` is true\
    \ (meaning `$a->[0]` is greater than `$b->[0]`), else return `$b->[0]`\"\n<|/\
