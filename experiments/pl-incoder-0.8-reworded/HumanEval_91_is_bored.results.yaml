    \ implement it. However, in the next step I want to use the Perl modules \"Algorithm::Text::Segments\"\
    \ and \"Algorithm::Text::Runs\" to process big files. Do you think the module\
    \ \"Algorithm::Text::Segments\" will support that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo, there's\
    \ no `Algorithm::Text::Runs` module, but I'm sure there's a way to process segments\
    \ with it. Good luck with your project!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHi, thank you for\
    \ your help. I was able to do what you proposed and it works fine. However, I\
    \ did some search and found that \"Algorithm::Text::Runs\" was a Perl module that\
    \ allows me to do the same thing. I thought it could help me in the future when\
    \ I'm working with big files. Do you think it is worth investigating it further\
    \ when I will be dealing with big files? Thanks in advance.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I doubt that it will be useful for processing very large files. But if you need\
    \ to process very large files then it is worth investigating.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nThe `Algorithm::Text::Runs` module is meant to process **big** files by\
    \ splitting them into smaller chunks. Since you did not specify a particular programming\
    \ language, my answer was written in Perl. Perl is one of the programming languages\
    \ supported **by many** Unix programs. If you think you can process **big** files\
    \ using a programming language not supported by your `Algorithm::Text::Runs` module\
    \ then you should ask yourself why your problem could be solved differently.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=string,algorithm,c++,c |>\nYou could use a std::vector and\
    \ use std::find to find the first occurrence of the string \"I\". Something like\
    \ this:\n<code>\nbool is_bored(const std::string& s)\n{\n    std::vector<std::string>\
    \ v;\nuse Test::Deep;\n\n\nsub testhumaneval {\n    my $candidate = \\&is_bored;\n\
    \        if(eq_deeply($candidate->(\"Hello world\"),0)) {\n        print \"ok!\"\
    \ }else{\n        exit 1;\n        }\n        if(eq_deeply($candidate->(\"Is the\
    \ sky blue?\"),0)) {\n        print \"ok!\" }else{\n        exit 1;\n        }\n\
    \        if(eq_deeply($candidate->(\"I love It !\"),1)) {\n        print \"ok!\"\
    \ }else{\n        exit 1;\n        }\n        if(eq_deeply($candidate->(\"bIt\"\
    ),0)) {\n        print \"ok!\" }else{\n        exit 1;\n        }\n        if(eq_deeply($candidate->(\"\
