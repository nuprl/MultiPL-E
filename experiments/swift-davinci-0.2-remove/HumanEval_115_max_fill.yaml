prompt: "\n/// You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single\
  \ well,\n/// and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.\n/// Each well\
  \ has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, \n/// and\
  \ all buckets have the same capacity.\n/// Your task is to use the buckets to empty\
  \ the wells.\n/// Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.\n///\
  \ Example 1:\n/// Example 2:\n/// Example 3:\n/// Constraints:\n/// * all wells\
  \ have the same length\n/// * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2\n/// * 1 <= grid[:,1].length\
  \ <= 10^2\n/// * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1\n/// * 1 <= capacity <= 10\nfunc max_fill(grid:\
