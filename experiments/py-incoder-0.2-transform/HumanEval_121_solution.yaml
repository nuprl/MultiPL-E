    \ by the formula:\n\n$Fn = \\begin{cases}\n1 & n = 0\\\n1 & n = 1 \\\nF{n-1} +\
    \ F_{n-2} & n > 1\n\\end{cases}$\n\nwhere $F_n$ is the n-th number in the Fibonacci\
    \ sequence. An example of a Fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,\
    \ 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nThe first two terms will give us a recurrence relation:\n\
    \n$Fn = F{n-1} + F_{n-2}$\n\nFrom this we can get the golden ratio:\n\n$\\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}\
    \ = \\frac{1+1}{1+1}$\n\nUsing the Master Theorem, we can solve for $F_n$ using\
    \ the following formula:\n\n$Fn = \\frac{F_{n+1}(1+\\frac{F_n}{F_{n+1}}) - F_n}{F_{n+1}}$\n\
    \nWhere we have used $F{n+1}$ in the previous formula to denote the $n+1$th Fibonacci\
    \ number. This formula works for all integers $n$, including negative integers.\n\
    \nWhat is the value of $F_n$ when $n$ = 50?\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    even =\

    Notice that in the above solution, there are two for loops. One is for counting\
    \ how many times the element appears in the odd position. The other is for counting\
    \ how many times the element appears in the even position. These two for loops\
    \ are combined into one for loop. Then, they are summed.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\n\
