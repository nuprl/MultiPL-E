prompt: "def file_name_check(file_name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Create a function\
  \ which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the\
  \ the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered\
  \ to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    -\
  \ There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n   \
  \ - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the\
  \ dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet\
  \ ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the dot should be one of these:\
  \ ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check('example.txt')\n\

    Write a function that takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n\
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\nA file's name\
    \ is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \nare\
    \ met:\n- There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n\
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n- The substring before the dot\
    \ should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \nthe latin alphapet ('a'-'z'\
    \ and 'A'-'Z').\n- The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt',\
    \ 'exe', 'dll']\n- There should not be more than two digits ('0'-'9') in the file's\
    \ name.\nExamples:\n>>> file_name_check('example.txt')\n'Yes'\n>>> file_name_check('1example.dll')\n\
