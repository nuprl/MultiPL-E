    \ if the result string is palindrome.\n    A string is called palindrome if it\
    \ reads the same backward as forward.\n    You should return a tuple containing\
    \ the result string and True/False for the check.\n    Example\n    >>> reverse_delete('abcde',\
    \ 'ae')\n    ('bcd', False)\n    >>> reverse_delete('abcdef', 'b')\n    ('acdef',\
    \ False)\n    >>> reverse_delete('abcdedcba', 'ab')\n    ('cdedc', True)\n   \
