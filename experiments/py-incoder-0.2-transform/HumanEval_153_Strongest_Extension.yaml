  \ List[str]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"You will be given the name of a class (a string)\
  \ and a list of extensions.\n    The extensions are to be used to load additional\
  \ classes to the class. The\n    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP\
  \ be the number of the uppercase\n    letters in the extension's name, and let SM\
  \ be the number of lowercase letters \n    in the extension's name, the strength\
  \ is given by the fraction CAP - SM. \n    You should find the strongest extension\
  \ and return a string in this \n    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\n\
  \    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should\n  \
  \  choose the one that comes first in the list.\n    For example, if you are given\
  \ \"Slices\" as the class and a list of the\n    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese',\
  \ 'StuFfed'] then you should\n    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes'\
  \ is the strongest extension \n    (its strength is -1).\n    Example:\n    >>>\
  \ Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])\n    'my_class.AA'\n    \"\
