    </cell>\n<text>\nProblem 3\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\
    \nFn = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\
    \nThe first few terms of the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,\
    \ 89, 144, ...\n\nBy starting with F(1), you can compute the next term in the\
    \ sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\
    \nUsing the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute the next ten\
    \ terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute\
    \ the next hundred terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),\
    \ where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with\
    \ F(1), you can compute the next thousand terms in the sequence as follows:\n\n\
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above,\
    \ and starting with F(1), you can compute the next tenthousand terms in the sequence\
    \ as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing\
    \ the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute the next million\
    \ terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute\
    \ the next billion terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),\
    \ where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with\
    \ F(1), you can compute the next trillion terms in the sequence as follows:\n\n\
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above,\
    \ and starting with F(1), you can compute the next quadrillion terms in the sequence\
    \ as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1", "    \n    \n  \
