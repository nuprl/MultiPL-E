    </cell>\n<text>\nProblem 3\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\
    \nFn = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\
    \nThe first few terms of the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,\
    \ 89, 144, ...\n\nBy starting with F(1), you can compute the next term in the\
    \ sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\
    \nUsing the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute the next ten\
    \ terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute\
    \ the next hundred terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),\
    \ where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with\
    \ F(1), you can compute the next thousand terms in the sequence as follows:\n\n\
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above,\
    \ and starting with F(1), you can compute the next tenthousand terms in the sequence\
    \ as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing\
    \ the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute the next million\
    \ terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with F(1), you can compute\
    \ the next billion terms in the sequence as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),\
    \ where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above, and starting with\
    \ F(1), you can compute the next trillion terms in the sequence as follows:\n\n\
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).\n\nUsing the formula above,\
    \ and starting with F(1), you can compute the next quadrillion terms in the sequence\
    \ as follows:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) = F(n-1", "    \n    \n  \

    \ Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1\nF(n) =\
    \ F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)\n\nFor example, F(10) = 55 and F(100) = 99.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(0), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 1,000.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(1), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 10,000.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(2), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 100,000.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(3), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 1,000,000.\n\nBy\
    \ starting with F(4), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 10,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(5), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 100,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(6), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 1,000,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(7), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 10,000,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(8), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 100,000,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(9), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 1,000,000,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(10), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 10,000,000,000,000.\n\
    \nBy starting with F(100), you can calculate the sequence F(n) for n \u2264 100,000,000,000,000.\n\
    \nAlthough F(1000) would not be very large, it is unlikely to ever be calculated,\n\
    so F(1000) is used in place of F(10). Write a program to calculate F(100000).\n\

    \ 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = 1\n\
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), where F(0) is 0 and F(1) is 1.\n\nFor example, F(10)\
    \ = 55 and F(9) = 89.\n\nThe first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,\
    \ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.\n\nBy starting with F(0), we can compute\
    \ the sequence F(10).\n\nBy starting with F(1), we can compute the sequence F(9).\n\
    \nNow let us list the 50 first terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do\
    \ not exceed four million.\n\nBy starting with F(2), we reach the 89 term of the\
    \ sequence.\n\nBy continuing with the previous example, we get F(10) = 55 and\
    \ F(9) = 89.\n\nF(50) should return the last term.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "  \

    Problem 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\n$$ Fn = \\begin{cases}\n\
    1 & n = 1 \\\n1 & n = 2 \\\nF{n-1} + F_{n-2} & n > 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere\
    \ $F_n$ is the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \nThe first two terms, $F_1$\
    \ and $F_2$, are not zero. \nBy starting with $F_0$ = 0, \nwe obtain the following\
    \ sequence: $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F{n-2}, F_n$.\n\nBy using the formula above, we\
    \ get:\n\n$$ Fn = F{n-1} + F_{n-2} + \\ldots + F_1 $$\n\nThe first few terms of\
    \ the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, \n3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,\

    Problem 3\nWrite a Python program to find the number of triples (a, b, c) where\
    \ a, b, c are all positive integers. \nThe triplet (ai, bi, ci) is called a triple\
    \ if ai, bi, ci are all positive integers.\n\nExample :\nInput: a = 3, b = 5,\
    \ c = 7\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nThe only valid triplet is (3, 5, 7).\n\n</text>\n\

    Problem 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\n$Fn = \\begin{cases}\n\
    1 & n = 1 \\\n1 & n = 2 \\\nF{n-1} + F_{n-2} & n > 2\n\\end{cases}$\n\nwhere $F_1\
    \ = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.\n\nBy starting with $F_n = F{n-1}$ and repeatedly applying\
    \ the formula, we get the following sequence:\n\n$Fn = F{n-1} + F_{n-2}$\n\nFor\
    \ example, as we approach $n = 17$, the $F_{17}$ is incremented by 1, and $F_{16}$\
    \ by 1.\n\nBy starting with $F_1$ and $F_2$, we can compute $F{n}$ with $F_n =\
    \ F1 + F2$\n\nFor example, to compute $F_5$ with $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 2$:\n\n\

    \nFn = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for\

    \ 0 and F(1) = 1 and iterating through the sequence F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), \n\
    you will reach the nth term of the sequence F(n). \nFor example, F(3) = F(2) +\
    \ F(1) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1 \nand F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = F(3) + F(2) = F(2)\
    \ + F(1) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1 \nand so on. \nBy using the formula F(n) =\
    \ F(n-1) + F(n-2), you can compute the n'th term of the sequence \nF(n) = F(n-1)\
    \ + F(n-2) + F(n-3) + ... + F(2) \nand so on until F(1) = 1 and F(0) = 0.\n\n\
