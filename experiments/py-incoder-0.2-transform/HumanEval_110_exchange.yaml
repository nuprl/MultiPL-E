  \ of elements\n    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n    There\
  \ is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n    If\
  \ it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n    all\
  \ the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return \"NO\"\
