    Problem 8\nGiven a binary search tree and a node in that tree, find the in-order\
    \ successor of that node in the BST.\n\nFor example, given the following tree:\n\
    \n      5\n     / \\\n    4   8\n   / \\\n  2   7\nAnd a node with value 4, return\
    \ its in-order successor which is also a leaf node.\n\nFollow up: What if the\
    \ given tree is a perfect binary search tree? (The in-order successor of every\
    \ node would be its immediate predecessor.)\n\nFollow up: What if the given tree\
    \ is a skewed tree? (The in-order successor of every node would be either its\
    \ immediate successor or the next smallest value in its subtree.)\n\n\n</text>\n\

    Problem 8\nGiven a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given\
    \ nodes in the tree.\n\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \u201C\
    The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest\
    \ node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be\
    \ a descendant of itself).\u201D\n\nExample 1\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 1\n\n\
    Output: 1\n\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is 1.\n\nExample 2\nInput:\
    \ root = [1,2], v = 3\n\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is\
    \ 3.\n\nExample 3\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 2\n\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is 2.\n\nExample 4\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 0\n\nOutput:\
    \ 0\n\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is 0.\n\nExample 5\nInput: root =\
    \ [1,2], v = -1\n\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is 2, since\
    \ 1 is the lowest node that has both 1 and 2 as descendants.\n\nExample 6\nInput:\
    \ root = [1,2], v = 4\n\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is\
    \ -1, since 4 is the lowest node that has both 1 and 2 as descendants.\n\nExample\
    \ 7\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 5\n\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes\
    \ 1 and 2 is -1, since 5 is the lowest node that has both 1 and 2 as descendants.\n\
    \nExample 8\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 6\n\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation: The LCA\
    \ of nodes 1 and 2 is -1, since 6 is the lowest node that has both 1 and 2 as\
    \ descendants.\n\nExample 9\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 7\n\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\
    \ The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is -1, since 7 is the lowest node that has both 1 and\
    \ 2 as descendants.\n\nExample 10\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 8\n\nOutput: -1\n\n\
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 1 and 2 is -1, since 8 is the lowest node that has\
    \ both 1 and 2 as descendants.\n\nExample 11\nInput: root = [1,2], v = 9\n\nOutput:\
    \ -1\n\nExplanation", "    \n    # Your code here\n    \n    return 0\n</cell>\n\

    \ ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\n\nAccording to the definition\
    \ of LCA on Wikipedia: \u201CThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two\
    \ nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where\
    \ we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).\u201D\n\nThe function LCA(root,\
    \ p, q) takes in two nodes root and p, where root is assumed to be the root node\
    \ of a binary search tree and p and q are assumed to be the two nodes in the tree\
    \ being compared.\n\nThe function should return an integer that is the lowest\
    \ common ancestor of p and q in the binary search tree that includes root in the\
    \ path from p to q.\n\nFor example, given the following binary search tree:\n\n\
    \     3\n    / \\\n   9  20\n    /  \\\n   15   7\nThe lowest common ancestor\
    \ (LCA) of nodes 5 and 15 would be 5, since it is the lowest node that includes\
    \ both of them in the path from 5 to 15. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and\
    \ 20.\n\nNote: The function should return -1 if either of the nodes is None (as\
    \ in None). You may assume that each node has a valid integer value between [-10000,\
    \ 10000] inclusive.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    # Your code here\n    \n    return\

    \ tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\n\
    \nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \u201CThe lowest common ancestor\
    \ is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v\
    \ and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).\u201D\
    \n\nThe function LCA(root, p, q) takes in two nodes root and p, where root is\
    \ assumed to be the root of the binary tree and p and q are assumed to be two\
    \ nodes in the tree. Function should return their lowest common ancestor.\n\n\
    Example 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The LCA\
    \ of nodes 1 and 2 is 1, since both of them are descendants of root (1).\n\nExample\
    \ 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The LCA of\
    \ nodes 1 and 3 is 2, since path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is a valid LCA of nodes 1 and 3.\n\
    \nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 2, q = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 2 and 1 is 1, since path 2 -> 1 is a valid LCA of nodes 2 and 1.\n\
    \nExample 4:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 2, q = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 2 and 3 is 2, since path 2 -> 3 is a valid LCA of nodes 2 and 3.\n\
    \nExample 5:\n\nInput: root = [1,3], p = 1, q = 6\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 1 and 6 is 1, since path 1 -> 6 is a valid LCA of nodes 1 and 6.\n\
    \nExample 6:\n\nInput: root = [1,3], p = 6, q = 5\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 6 and 5 is 6, since path 6 -> 5 is a valid LCA of nodes 6 and 5.\n\
    \nExample 7:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 2, q = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 2 and 5 is 2, since path 2 -> 5 is a valid LCA of nodes 2 and 5.\n\
    \nExample 8:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 5, q = 8\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The\
    \ LCA of nodes 5 and 8 is 5, since path 5 ", "    \n    # Your code here\n   \
