    Now that we know how to use Python's statistical libraries (NumPy and SciPy) for\
    \ statistical computing, we can use the datasets we've created to explore some\
    \ of our favorite statistical metrics. We've learned that we can calculate the\
    \ mean of a list of numbers with the np.mean() function, or the mean of a given\
    \ set of numbers with the np.mean() function or the mean_absolute_deviation()\
    \ function. The latter two will calculate the mean of any set of numbers, but\
    \ the former two will only calculate the mean of numbers in a given list. We've\
    \ also learned that we can calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers\
    \ with the np.std() function, and the standard deviation of a given set of numbers\
    \ with the np.std() function or the np.stdabs()function. We've also learned that\
    \ we can calculate variance of a set of numbers with the np.var() function, and\
    \ the variance of a given set of numbers with the np.var() function or the np.varabs()function.\n\
    \nSo far we have learned the basics of calculating statistics. Now let's move\
    \ on to using these datasets to answer the questions we pose to our data. For\
    \ example, can we calculate a mean for the number of males and females in our\
    \ dataset using Python's statistical libraries? Or can we calculate the variance\
    \ of the number of males and females in our dataset? Or can we calculate the standard\
    \ deviation for the number of males and females in our dataset? What would be\
    \ the difference between using one or the other?\n\nIn the next cell, we will\
    \ explore answering this question with our dataset.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nCalculating\
