    \ can see that we used a list comprehension to generate the list we needed in\
    \ the compare() function. This makes compare() a bit easier to read. \nWe then\
    \ used the function zip() to combine our scores and guesses into tuples of (score,\
    \ guess). The zip function will return a generator of tuples composed of both\
    \ scores/guesses. We then use list() to convert this generator to a list.\nWe\
    \ then use an if statement and a list comprehension to check if each guess/score\
    \ is greater than the other (i.e. the score is wrong) or if the guesses are equal\
    \ (i.e. the score is correct). We then return the corresponding difference of\
    \ the scores and guesses.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef check(candidate):\n    assert\

    \ scores)` line splits that list into `guesses` and `scores` and stores them in\
    \ an iterable object, which we then iterate through. Thus we can access the values\

    \ c |>\nI understand now. Thanks for your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI should add\
    \ that if you don't have the `zip` function, you can use `for guess in guesses:`\
    \ for the same effect. I find the `zip` function easier to understand when I use\
    \ it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks! I actually figured out how you used it (but\

    \ the compare function.\nWe'll be working with two arrays: one containing the\
    \ scores and one containing the guesses.\nWe'll be assuming that each value of\
    \ the score array is between 1 and 10. We'll also assume that each value of the\
    \ guesses array is between 1 and 10.\nIn other words, score is a score between\
    \ 0 and 10, where 0 means \"impossible\" and 10 means \"correct\". \nFor each\
    \ score value, the value of each of the guesses values should match to determine\
    \ if they were correct.\nHere's how we would do that:\n\nCalculate the absolute\
    \ value of the difference between the scores and the guesses.\nFor each value\
    \ in the score array, check whether that value is in the guesses array.\nIf so,\
    \ add that value to the output array. If not, add 0.\nReturn the output array.\n\
