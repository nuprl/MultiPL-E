    Solution\nTo help you visualize what's happening here, you're going to look at\
    \ your car's trajectory as it moves through these two races.\n\nTo visualize what\
    \ your car is doing, it's a good idea to plot your car's position as it moves\
    \ through both races.  The position of your car will give you a better sense for\
    \ how well it is doing.  You'll also see some lines appear which represent the\
    \ path the car is taking, which you won't be making sense of yet--you'll learn\
    \ more about it later.\n\nTo get started, you'll need to initialize your car's\
    \ initial position.  Remember that your car is initially located at the top left\
    \ corner of the screen.  You'll also need two variables to keep track of where\
    \ you are: the x position and y position of your car.  You'll also need to keep\
    \ track of whether you're moving left or right.  Finally, you'll need to keep\
    \ track of the previous position of your car.  Remember that you'll also need\
    \ to modify your car_update function to allow for the case in which your car is\
    \ going through a collision, in which case it will need to update the previous\
    \ position of your car.\n\nIn the cell below, I've initialized your car's initial\
    \ position, the x position and y position.  Your car will initially be located\
    \ at the top left corner of the screen.\n\nIn the cell below, I've initialized\
    \ two variables to keep track of where you are in your car's trajectory.  I chose\
    \ to initialize both of these to 0.  You'll learn more about keeping track of\
    \ your car's x and y position later in the course.\n\nFinally, I've modified your\
    \ car_update function to allow the case in which your car has collided with the\
    \ left or right lane.  If a car collides with a lane at index 1, then it will\
    \ need to update the previous position of your car to make way for the car in\
    \ index 0.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(2)\
