    <text>\nRecursion\n\n</text>\n<text>\nA Recursive function is simply a function\
    \ that calls itself. \nRecursive functions can be used to solve any recursive\
    \ problem, and we can call this recursive function as Recursive Solution.\n\n\
    To explain why this recursion solution is recursive let us start with some mathematical\
    \ formula.\nConsider the Fibonacci sequence which is defined as follows:\nfibonacci(1)\
    \ = 1\nfibonacci(2) = 1\nfibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n\
    Examples:\nfibonacci(1) = 1\nfibonacci(2) = 1\nfibonacci(3) = fibonacci(1) + fibonacci(2)\n\
    fibonacci(4) = fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2)\nfibonacci(5) = fibonacci(4) + fibonacci(3)\n\
    fibonacci(6) = fibonacci(5) + fibonacci(4)\nfibonacci(7) = fibonacci(6) + fibonacci(5)\n\
    fibonacci(8) = fibonacci(7) + fibonacci(6)\nfibonacci(9) = fibonacci(8) + fibonacci(7)\n\
    The mathematical formula for Fibonacci sequence is as follows:\n$$f(n)=\\begin{cases}\n\
    \    1 & \\text{if}\\ n=1\\\n    1 & \\text{if}\\ n=2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow let's\
    \ take a recursive solution to the above problem and see how it works.\nThe recursion\
    \ formula for Fibonacci sequence is as follows:\n$$f(n)=\\begin{cases}\n    1\
    \ & \\text{if}\\ n=1\\\n    f(n-1)+f(n-2) & \\text{if}\\ n=2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\
    It can be easily written as an iterative version as:\n$$f(n)=\\begin{cases}\n\
    \    1 & \\text{if}\\ n=1\\\n    f(n-1)+f(n-2) & \\text{if}\\ n=2\n\\end{cases}\n\
    $$\nLet's now define the recursion function recurse(f,n).\ndef check(candidate):\n\

    Recursion\nRecursion is a method to solve problems where the solution depends\
    \ on the solution of a smaller problem. In other words, solving problems within\
    \ themselves.\n\nIn programming, recursion involves breaking a problem down into\
    \ smaller sub-problems. These smaller problems are solved using a technique called\
    \ a divide and conquer strategy. For example, consider the following problem:\n\
    \nGiven an integer n, find the least positive integer which can be written as\
    \ the sum of two abundant numbers, where each number in the sum is less than or\
    \ equal to n.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the recursive approach. We\
    \ will first break the problem into smaller sub-problems, and then solve them\
    \ recursively. Let's start with the base case.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef check(candidate):\n\
