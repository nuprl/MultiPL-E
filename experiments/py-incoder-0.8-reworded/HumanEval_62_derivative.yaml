    \ 3: Finding the roots of a polynomial equation\n\n</text>\n<text>\nIn calculus,\
    \ we often find multiple roots of a polynomial equation to solve numerically.\
    \ For example, the quadratic equation ($x^2 + 2x + 3$) can be solved analytically\
    \ to give the roots $x = -1$ and $x = 2$. How can we find these roots with our\
    \ polynomial function?\n\nWe can use what's called a bisection method to find\
    \ the roots (see Wikipedia). In brief, we divide the interval [-10, 10] into n\
    \ equal intervals, each containing the value of $x$ at that point (we can use\
    \ np.linspace).\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "    # Initialize result\n    answer =\
