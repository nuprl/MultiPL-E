    <text>\nA Sieve of Eratosthenes is a procedure which generates all prime numbers\
    \ less than a specified maximum.\n\nThe sieve of Eratosthenes works best with\
    \ numbers that are relatively prime, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n\nIt works\
    \ best on relatively small numbers, but is very inefficient with larger numbers,\
    \ because all prime numbers up to and including $n$ must be generated.\n\nThe\
    \ sieve of Eratosthenes can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ time, because\
    \ of the use of sieve of Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\nIn this problem, you will find\
    \ out how to apply the sieve of Eratosthenes to solve a problem.\n\n\n</text>\n\

    \n\n</text>\n<text>\nNext up: String Manipulation II\nIn the video lectures, we've\
    \ seen how to use string slicing and concatenation to\nreorder and merge parts\
    \ of a string. You'll be using these tools again in the following videos.\n\n\
    Here's the string '123' again:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nsentence = '123'\n</cell>\n\
    <text>\nIf you wanted to extract the first character from this sentence, you could\
    \ do so by writing sentence[0]. The character at position zero in this string\
    \ is actually '1'.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\nsentence[0]\n</cell>\n<text>\nHowever,\
    \ in some cases, you need to extract characters in more than one position in order\
    \ to do things you could have done previously. For example, let's say you wanted\
    \ to find the first character in the string '123', but you only wanted it to extract\
    \ the first three. In this case, you could use string slicing:\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <cell>\nsentence[0:3]\n</cell>\n<text>\nNote that we're still using the slice\
    \ notation, but we have explicitly given the start position (0) and the end position\
    \ (3). Note also that the start position can be omitted. In this case, the slice\
    \ will return all the characters up until the end of the string, which is indicated\
    \ by the number 4 in this case.\n\nWe can do the same thing with string concatenation:\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<cell>\nsentence + sentence[0:3]\n</cell>\n<text>\nAs an example,\
    \ we can use the + operator to add two strings together, in this case we are adding\
    \ '1' to the beginning of the string and '3' to the end of the string:\n\n\n</text>\n\
    <cell>\n'1' + sentence[0:3]\n</cell>\n<text>\nThis can be useful if we wanted\
    \ to insert a space at the beginning of a string:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\n'1' +\
    \ ' ' + sentence[0:3]\n</cell>\n<text>\nExercise: Find out how many characters\
    \ in the string '123' are consecutive. Make sure you understand the implications\
    \ of adding or subtracting numbers from a string. Try it out on your own first\
    \ before trying out on real words.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef check(candidate):\n\
