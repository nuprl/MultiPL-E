    \ what you are doing. I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me. :)\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's a lot simpler than the previous solution. I'm only adding\
    \ the meals up, and subtracting the carrots left. I don't need recursion. Just\
    \ a while loop. I'll add an explanation shortly.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay I got\
    \ it now! So to finish it up, I need to take care of the case when carrots_left\
    \ is greater than need. So I should add one to meals and subtract one from carrots_left\
    \ then? Is that right? It would make more sense to me to just have the while loop\
    \ iterate until carrots_left is equal to need. \n\nI feel like I'm understanding\
    \ it, but I see why you did it this way. Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited\
    \ my answer so that it works for the case when carrots_left is greater than need.\
