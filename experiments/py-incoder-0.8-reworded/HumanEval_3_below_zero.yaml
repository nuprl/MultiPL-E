    \ if any of the operations on account is below zero ? My question is how would\
    \ I detect if any operations are below zero in the list operations. I tried the\
    \ code you gave me but I'm still not able to figure it out!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I think you can figure that out yourself if you'd spend a little more time with\
    \ it. If you've got problems, you can post a new question here on SO with the\
    \ relevant details and a description about what you've tried and why that doesn't\
    \ work. Good luck!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python,algorithm,data-structures dscore=1\
    \ |>\nThis sounds like a problem that could be solved with linear time complexity:\n\
    \nIf you have a balance of B, and a deposit of D, you would have to make at most\
    \ a total of B+D operations on your balance.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop,\
    \ you could do either of the following operations:\n\nIf the balance of B is negative,\
    \ subtract the current balance from B.\nIf the balance of B is positive, add the\
    \ current balance to B. \n\nThis would guarantee that your balance would never\
    \ be negative.\nThe time complexity of this would be O(n) (where n is the number\
    \ of iterations of the loop).\n<|/ a |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\n<code>", "    pass\n\
