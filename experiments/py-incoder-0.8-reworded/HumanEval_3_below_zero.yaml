    \nIf you have a balance of B, and a deposit of D, you would have to make at most\
    \ a total of B+D operations on your balance.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop,\
    \ you could do either of the following operations:\n\nIf the balance of B is negative,\
    \ subtract the current balance from B.\nIf the balance of B is positive, add the\
    \ current balance to B. \n\nThis would guarantee that your balance would never\
    \ be negative.\nThe time complexity of this would be O(n) (where n is the number\
