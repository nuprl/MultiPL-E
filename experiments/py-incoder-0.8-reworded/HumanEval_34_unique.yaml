    Thanks for sharing this. For people who are looking for a fast way to do this,\
    \ see my answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nFor this solution you should make `l` a set.\
    \ Set elements are unordered and hence `unique` would be a misnomer for this problem.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`sorted(list(set(l)))`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe above solution\
    \ `unique(l) ` doesn't work for string values. For example, if `l=['a','b','a']`,\
    \ the output will be `['a', 'b']`. However, if you use set(), it will work as\
    \ intended.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHi , How about this solutions https://stackoverflow.com/questions/369814/how-do-you-remove-duplicates-from-a-list\n\
