    \ to a list:\n<code>\n>>> a = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5]\n>>> list(set(a))\n[1,2,3,4,5]\n\
    </code>\nThis doesn't preserve the original order of the elements in the original\
    \ list, but that wasn't a requirement in your question.  It's easy to preserve\
    \ the order with this:\n<code>\n>>> from collections import OrderedDict\n>>> list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(a))\n\
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code>\nIf ordering is unimportant, then this works just fine:\n\
    <code>\n>>> a = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5]\n>>> list(set(a))\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code>\n\
    The performance is likely to be similar to the performance of the sort-based solutions,\
    \ because those are both quadratic time algorithms.  But I did a quick time test:\n\
    <code>\n$ python -m timeit -s 'import test; a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]' 'list(set(a))'\n\
    1000 loops, best of 3: 714 usec per loop\n$ python -m timeit -s 'import test;\

    \ per loop\n$ python -m timeit -s 'import test; a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]'\
    \ 'list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(a))'\n100 loops, best of 3: 11.3 msec per loop\n\

    You can use itertools.groupby and use itemgetter function to do your job.\n<code>\n\
    from itertools import groupby\n\nl = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nfinal = list(map(itemgetter(0),\
