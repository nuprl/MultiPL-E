    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=5 |>\n<| c |>\nIt should be noted that this solution doesn't\
    \ preserve order of elements in the input list\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis answer\
    \ is not wrong, but it doesn't answer the original question. While it does work,\
    \ it's not a particularly efficient approach.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, your answer\
    \ is right. I've added an update to my answer to solve it with `set`\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThank you for your answer. Could you give some explanation why this approach\
    \ is more efficient? I cannot understand how a set helps here.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nThe set is faster to check if an element has already been seen than to check\
    \ if an element is contained in the list.  See [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/460633/166749)\
    \ for more details.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python,algorithm,list dscore=5 |>\nThis\
    \ can also be done via a set and remove:\n<code>\n>>> my_list = ['1','2','3','3','2','1','4','1']\n\
    >>> my_list = list(set(my_list))\n>>> my_list\n['1', '2', '3', '4']\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThis will remove the duplicates but will return the list in\
    \ their original order. Is there a way to return the list in their original order\
    \ but without duplicates retained?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I believe the original\
    \ order is preserved with this solution. Perhaps you want to use `sorted` on the\
    \ returned list? Or, more specifically, `sorted(my_list)`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    This will only work if all items are hashable (such as numbers). If you need to\
    \ compare for equality of strings, for example, this won't work.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\n: Well, in this specific case, no. But in general, no.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nThe original order is preserved but this solution doesn't preserve the order\
    \ of the items in the list that have duplicates.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=python,algorithm,list\
