    \ |>\nYour code doesn't work because you use foreach to iterate over each character\
    \ in the string. foreach is designed to iterate over sequences of elements. In\
    \ your case, the elements are characters. So foreach will iterate over each character\
    \ in the string and assign it to c. However, c is a character, not a string, so\
    \ you can't use foreach to iterate over it.\nTo fix your code, you can use a for\
    \ loop:\n<code>\nlong is_bored(string S) \n{\n    long boredoms = 0;\n    \n \
    \   for(int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++)\n    {\n        if(S[i] == '.' || S[i]\

    \ for your answer! I understand it now. One last question, how would I be able\

    \ that? Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou can just call it like any other function:\
    \ `long boredoms = is_bored(\"Hello world\");`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI did that,\
