    \ like your solution, but I believe that `distinct` should be `distinctBy` since\
    \ it returns distinct elements by a key (in this case, by their position in the\
    \ string). Also, `distinct` should be `distinctBy` since it returns distinct elements\
    \ by a key (in this case, by their position in the string).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
