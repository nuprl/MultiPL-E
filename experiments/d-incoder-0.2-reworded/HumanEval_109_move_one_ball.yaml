prompt: "import std.math;\nimport std.typecons;\n/*\nWe have an array 'arr' of N integers\
  \ arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered.\
  \ Your task is to determine if\n    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing\
  \ order by performing \n    the following operation on the given array:\n      \
  \  You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.\n    \n\
  \    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one\n\
  \    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved\
  \ to\n    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. \n\n    If it is possible\
  \ to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation\n    then return\
  \ true else return false.\n    If the given array is empty then return true.\n\n\
  \    Note: The given array is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\n    For Example:\n\
  \    \n    >>> move_one_ball([3L, 4L, 5L, 1L, 2L])\n    true\n    Explanation: By\
  \ performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n               \
  \  be achieved for the given array.\n    >>> move_one_ball([3L, 5L, 4L, 1L, 2L])\n\
