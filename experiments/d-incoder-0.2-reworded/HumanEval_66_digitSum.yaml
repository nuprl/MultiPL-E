    \ Your explanation is very helpful.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe foreach loop doesn't\

    I like this solution, but I wonder why you used `isUpper` instead of `isalpha`?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`isUpper` checks if the character is upper case letter. `isalpha`\
    \ checks if the character is alphabetic character. `isalpha` is more general than\
