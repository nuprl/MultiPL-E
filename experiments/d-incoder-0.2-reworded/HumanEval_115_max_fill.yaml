    \ function calculates the number of ways to fill the grid with the specified capacity.\
    \ For example, if we want to fill the grid with capacity 1, then there are 2 ways\
    \ to do so: either we put a 1 at every position, or we put a 0 at every position.\
    \ So, if we want to fill the grid with capacity 1, then there are 2 ways to do\

    \ |>\nThis can be solved using dynamic programming.\nThe idea is to fill the grid\
    \ with the largest possible number of buckets until it reaches the desired capacity.\
    \ Then, we can fill the grid with the remaining capacity until it reaches 0. The\
    \ number of ways to fill the grid is the sum of the number of ways to fill the\
    \ grid with the largest number of buckets until it reaches the desired capacity.\
    \ \nThe algorithm is as follows:\n<code>\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    memo\
    \ = {}\n    memo[0] = 1\n    memo[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, len(grid)):\n\
    \        memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]\n    return memo[len(grid)-1]\n</code>\n\
