    \ function calculates the number of ways to fill the grid with the specified capacity.\
    \ For example, if we want to fill the grid with capacity 1, then there are 2 ways\
    \ to do so: either we put a 1 at every position, or we put a 0 at every position.\
    \ So, if we want to fill the grid with capacity 1, then there are 2 ways to do\

    \ |>\nThis can be solved using dynamic programming.\nThe idea is to fill the grid\
    \ with the largest possible number of buckets until it reaches the desired capacity.\
    \ Then, we can fill the grid with the remaining capacity until it reaches 0. The\
    \ number of ways to fill the grid is the sum of the number of ways to fill the\
    \ grid with the largest number of buckets until it reaches the desired capacity.\
    \ \nThe algorithm is as follows:\n<code>\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    memo\
    \ = {}\n    memo[0] = 1\n    memo[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, len(grid)):\n\
    \        memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]\n    return memo[len(grid)-1]\n</code>\n\

    <| a tags=algorithm,dynamic-programming,c++ |>\nThis problem can be solved using\
    \ dynamic programming.\nThe idea is to store the maximum water that can be extracted\
    \ from each bucket in a 2D array (let's call it maxWater). Then, for each row\
    \ and column of the grid, you can compute the maximum water that can be extracted\
    \ from each bucket by adding the maximum water that can be extracted from each\
    \ bucket in the left and right columns of the row. \nThe overall maximum water\
    \ that can be extracted from each bucket is then maxWater[i][j].\nThe code below\

    The problem is that the number of wells increases exponentially with the number\
    \ of columns. So the problem can be solved with a simple recursive solution:\n\
    <code>\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    if capacity == 0:\n        return 0\n\
    \    if capacity < 0:\n        return -1\n    if grid[0][0] == 1:\n        return\
    \ max_fill(grid[1:], capacity - 1)\n    else:\n        return max(max_fill(grid[1:],\
    \ capacity - 1), max_fill(grid[0], capacity - grid[0][0]))\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=algorithm,dynamic-programming,python,dynamic-programming\
