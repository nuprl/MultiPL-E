    \ a solution that doesn't use any library functions.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank\
    \ you very much! It works perfectly. Could you please explain me why you used\
    \ the variable maxWeight and sum? I understand that maxWeight is the maximum possible\
    \ weight and sum is the sum of the elements of the array, but I cannot understand\
    \ why you used these variables. Thank you very much!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used\
    \ these variables to keep track of the maximum possible weight and the sum of\
    \ the elements of the array. Initially, the maximum possible weight is `w`, and\
    \ the sum is `0`. When you add an element to the sum, you need to check if it's\
    \ greater than the maximum possible weight. If it is, then the maximum possible\
    \ weight is updated to the sum of the elements of the array. After the loop, the\
    \ maximum possible weight is equal to the sum of the elements of the array.\n\
