    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI really appreciate your help. I understand your code, but I do\
    \ not understand how it works. I understand that you are counting the number of\
    \ vowels in the string, but how does it know to count the vowels in the string\
    \ if the string has more than one vowel? Also, how does it know to count the vowels\
    \ in the string if the string has more than one vowel at the end of the string?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe code counts the number of vowels in the string by looping\
    \ through the string and counting the vowels. If the string has more than one\
    \ vowel it increments the vowels variable by one. For example, if the string was\
    \ \"abcde\" the vowels variable would be incremented by one because there are\
    \ two vowels in the string. Likewise, if the string was \"ACEDY\" the vowels variable\
    \ would be incremented by one because there are three vowels in the string. Hope\
