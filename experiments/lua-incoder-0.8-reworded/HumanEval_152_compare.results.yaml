    \ be able to use the absolute difference of the score and the guess and add it\
    \ to the guess if it is the same. I don't know if that is correct, but hopefully\
    \ it helps.\n<|/ a tags=algorithm,lua |>\n<| c |>\nI think you mean `abs(score-guess_result)`.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nFirst of all, you need to define what you mean by \"the difference\
    \ between the guess and the score\".  What exactly are you trying to tell us?\
    \  Do you want to know how far away a guess of \"1\" is from the actual score\
    \ of \"3\"?  If so, then you want the absolute value of the difference between\
    \ the two numbers, i.e. abs(3-1) = 3.\nSecondly, you have a function that takes\
    \ a table and returns a table.  You also have a function that takes two table\
    \ values and returns a table.  What exactly are you comparing those two functions\
    \ to?  If you're comparing them to determine which value has more \"points\",\
    \ then you're going to get a different answer.  Perhaps you want to compare their\
    \ lengths to determine which table is larger?\nWithout that info, we can't really\
    \ help you.\n<|/ a tags=algorithm,lua dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for answering\
    \ but this is just a simple version of what I'm trying to achieve. I am comparing\
    \ each element of first table with each element of second table and getting the\
    \ difference and checking if that difference is greater than 0 and if yes then\
    \ adding that difference to guesses table.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, that's not what\
    \ I said.  You say you're comparing each element of one table with each element\
    \ of another table.  What I'm saying is that you're comparing a table of values\
    \ to a single value.  That's not at all what your functions are supposed to do.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI tried to elaborate on my question a little bit more. Could\
    \ you please help me understand where I have went wrong? Thank you.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 |>\nI don't know the language you are using but it looks like you\
