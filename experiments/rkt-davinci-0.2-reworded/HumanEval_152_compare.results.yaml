    \ Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number\
    \ of matches.\n;; You are given two lists of scores and guesses of equal length,\
    \ where each index shows a match. \n;; Return a list of the same length denoting\
    \ how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n;; the value is\
    \ 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the\
    \ score.\n;; example:\n;; >>> (compare (list 1 2 3 4 5 1) (list 1 2 3 4 2 -2))\n\
