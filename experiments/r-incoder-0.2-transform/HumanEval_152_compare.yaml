prompt: "# I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\

  \ two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match.\
  \ \n# Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If\
  \ they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute\
  \ difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\n# >>> compare(c(1, 2,\
