prompt: "# It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades\n\

  \ you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write \n# a function that\
  \ can output a list of letter grades using the following table:\n# GPA       | \
  \   Letter grade\n# 4.0                A+\n# > 3.7                A \n# > 3.3  \
