    <|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm still trying to understand\
    \ how this works. I understand that `operator` should be a list of operators,\
    \ such as `['+', '*', '-']`, but I don't understand how `operand` should be a\
    \ list of numbers. How would I go about doing that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe `operand`\
    \ list should be a list of numbers. You just need to figure out how to convert\
    \ a number to a list. For example, `c(2, 3, 4, 5)` would return a list with those\
    \ numbers. You just need to figure out how to convert a number to a list.\n<|/\
