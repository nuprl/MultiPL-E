    \ for your answer. Your solution is very elegant and I learned a lot from it.\
    \ I just have one question: why do you use `c` instead of `list`?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n`c` is vectorized so it will return a vector instead of a list. `list`\
    \ will return a list but it will not vectorize. `c` is more efficient than `list`\
    \ because it doesn't need to allocate memory for the entire list before returning.\n\
