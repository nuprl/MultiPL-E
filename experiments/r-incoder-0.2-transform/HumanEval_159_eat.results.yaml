    \ it works, but I don't understand why it works. I understand that `if(number\
    \ < need)` will stop the function if there are not enough carrots to eat, but\
    \ I don't understand why `if(number == need)` will stop the function if there\
    \ are enough carrots to eat. Could you please explain it to me?\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nThe `if(number == need)` will stop the function if there are enough carrots\
    \ to eat. Because `number == need` will stop the function if there are enough\
    \ carrots to eat. `if(number < need)` will stop the function if there are not\
    \ enough carrots to eat. Because `number < need` will stop the function if there\
    \ are not enough carrots to eat. Hope this helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh I see.\
    \ So `number == need` will stop the function if there are enough carrots to eat,\
    \ but `number < need` will stop the function if there are not enough carrots to\
    \ eat. Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, that's right. `number == need` will\
    \ stop the function if there are enough carrots to eat, but `number < need` will\
