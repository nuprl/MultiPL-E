    \ of the original list except the element at the corresponding index in the sublist.\n\

    You are given an array of positive integers. \nThe product of any subarray is\
    \ the maximum product of its elements.\nFor example, given the array [1,2,3]\n\
    The product of any subarray is 1*2*3 = 6\nGiven an array with length $n$, find\
    \ the maximum product of any subarray of length $k$.\nThe product of any subarray\
    \ is $k^n$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\nFor example, given the array [1,2,3],\
    \ the maximum product of any subarray of length 2 is 6.\nGiven an array with length\
    \ $n$, find the maximum product of any subarray of length $k$.\nThe product of\
    \ any subarray is $k^n$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\nFor example, given\

    \ minimum number of moves to make all buckets full of water.\nThe buckets are\
    \ numbered from 0 to capacity-1 (both inclusive).\nThe water starts in the bucket\
    \ at index 0.\nThe goal is to move the water from bucket to bucket, until all\
    \ buckets are full of water.\nThe water can only be moved once from each bucket.\n\
    The moves are numbered from 0 to capacity-1 (both inclusive).\nExample:\nInput:\
    \ grid = [\n  [0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1]\n]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\
    \ \nThe minimum number of moves is 2 to make all buckets full of water.\nThe first\
    \ move is to move the water from bucket 0 to bucket 1, which leaves bucket 0 empty\
    \ and bucket 1 full of water.\nThe second move is to move the water from bucket\
    \ 1 to bucket 2, which leaves bucket 1 empty and bucket 2 full of water.\nThe\
    \ minimum number of moves is therefore 2.\n\n</text>\n<cell>", "\n  \n  n <- length(grid)\n\

    A more efficient solution is possible using dynamic programming.\n\nThe idea is\
    \ to remember which buckets need to be lowered and which buckets need to be raised.\
    \ The idea is to keep a table of buckets needed to be raised and lowered for each\
    \ well. Then, we can just loop through the wells and update this table accordingly.\n\
    \nThe table is initialized with capacity 1 for each bucket.\n\nThe idea is to\
