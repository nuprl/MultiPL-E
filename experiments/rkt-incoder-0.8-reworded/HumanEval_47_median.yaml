    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nsorry if it isn't clear.  I want the code to work.  Currently\
    \ the code produces a syntax error when I try to save it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The question was \"How to fix this code?\". Now the code is working and you also\
    \ have the answer, so why don't you accept the answer?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe\
    \ issue is that the code is not valid Scheme, and it appears to me that you have\
    \ assumed that \"Scheme\" is a generic word that means different things in different\
    \ contexts.  I assumed that Scheme refers to the scheme language used by Racket,\
    \ and it is the language that Racket uses.  I believe that Racket uses Scheme,\
    \ but I haven't confirmed.  Hence, I was looking for a solution that could fix\
    \ the code while using Racket as a means of getting the code to run.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThe question is \"How to fix this code?\", so it's clear that you have\
    \ problems with this code. I suggest you read the [Wikipedia article on Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language))\
    \ to learn how Scheme is different from other programming languages and how it\
    \ differs from most other programming languages. Then you will be able to find\
    \ out what is wrong with your code.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe problem is that you\
    \ assume that Scheme is an Scheme dialect. No, this is not a correct assumption.\n\
    Scheme is not a programming language, but a dialect of Scheme. Scheme is a language\
    \ with lots of features that are not available in other programming languages.\
    \ \nThe other answer explains that you cannot use racket to run Scheme code. Racket\
    \ is written in Scheme. \nThe Scheme language is specified by its standard and\
    \ the standard is specified in terms of Scheme. Thus, Scheme is a dialect of Scheme\
    \ and it is possible to run Scheme code with racket. Thus your code can run with\
    \ racket and it ", "  (/ (reduce + (map (lambda (x) (/ (min x l) (max x l))) l))\

    : Sure.  I added a comment to the code.  Basically, if l is empty it returns #f.\
    \  If it has one element it returns the element.  Otherwise, divide the first\
    \ element by the median, then subtract it from the rest of the elements.  This\
    \ does have the drawback that if l is one element it returns #f.  I guess I didn't\

    <|/ a tags=scheme,racket,lisp |>\n<| c |>\nI don't think you get median from your\
    \ first code block. I'm pretty sure you get the second one. `min`, `max` and `avg`\
    \ should return the smallest and largest of the list, respectively, and the average\
    \ should be the number of elements divided by the number of elements.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n: I got it from your second code block. `min` returns the minimum, `max`\
    \ returns the maximum, `avg` returns the sum of the list divided by the number\
    \ of elements. In your first code block you were also getting the minimum and\
    \ maximum, whereas you just wanted the median.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo, OP was\
    \ asking for the median and your first code block does not return the median.\
