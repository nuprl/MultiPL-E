    \ c) (b c)) ((a b) (a b) (a b))))?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt is not too complicated.\
    \ There are 3 cases when a letter needs to go into a \"bucket A\" then a \"bucket\
    \ B\" and then a \"bucket C\". For \"bucket A\" we know that the letter must go\
    \ into the \"bucket C\", for \"bucket B\" we know that the letter must go into\
    \ \"bucket A\" and \"bucket C\" and for \"bucket C\" we know that the letter must\
    \ go into \"bucket B\". Then we can get the list of letters from \"bucket C\"\
    \ by using a `map` of `(lambda (letter) (list letter ))` then we can append them\
    \ to the list of letters from \"bucket A\" and finally we can append them to the\
    \ list of letters from \"bucket B\". Does it make sense?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Yes. I think I got it. Thanks for your explanation!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOk I think\
    \ I finally got it. Thanks for your explanation.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme\
    \ dscore=1 |>\nYou could write a simple recursive function using a helper function.\
    \ In the helper function you would check which of the buckets has the letter and\
    \ move it to the other bucket if needed. You then go through all the letters in\
    \ the word one by one and move the letters to the buckets in the helper function\
    \ until you encounter a letter that is already in the correct bucket.\n<code>\n\

    \ the second example, \"go\" comes before \"for\" and \"swimming\". But the second\

    \ it works. But I'm still confused about how did you come up with the solution?\
    \ How did the looping work? Can I apply similar logic if there are more than 2\
    \ elements in a list?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe [for loop](http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for-loop.html)\
    \ works exactly the same way as in a procedural language.  `for-range?` is used\
    \ to generate a sequence of integers from `1` to `(in-range? sentence 100)`. \
    \ This is then used to iterate over all the words in `sentence`.  `for-range?`\
    \ returns a sequence of numbers from `1` to `(in-range? sentence 100)` by `2`,\
    \ so that's exactly what happens.  The `for-loop` simply uses `for-range?` to\
    \ create a sequence of all the numbers from `1` to `(in-range? sentence 100)`,\
    \ and then uses `for-loop` to iterate over those numbers.  This way the numbers\
    \ are all evenly spaced between `1` and `(in-range? sentence 100)`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\n`for-loop` does exactly the same thing as `for-range?` in functional\
    \ languages, except that it doesn't return a sequence.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks!\
    \ I'm still not quite familiar with the concept of recursion. Is there any good\
    \ resource I can read to better understand it?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIn a language\
    \ where `for-loop` does a tail-call, you just do `for-loop` recursively.  In a\
    \ language where `for-loop` does a while loop, you do `for-loop` inside a loop.\
    \  In either case, you keep calling the same function over and over, until the\
    \ loop condition changes.  So basically, whenever you see a recursive `for-loop`\
    \ in your code, you know that you're doing something with the return value from\
    \ the recursive function call.  So, in the case of `for-loop`, you keep calling\
    \ the same function over and over until the loop condition changes, and then you\
    \ stop.\n<|/ c \n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let ((\

    \ answer. It really helps me a lot. I'm trying out a problem in Racket, and I\
    \ have an assignment which asks me to return the number of prime numbers up to\
    \ the length of the sentence (up to 100 max). I'm confused on how to go about\
    \ this. Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAhh I see, I changed my answer to reflect\
    \ the changes in the question's constraints, please accept my answer. :)\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're welcome! By the way, this isn't a problem! You will soon\
    \ find out that in Racket you can write things like `for/list` to do all sorts\
    \ of cool things, and will soon be ready to read and understand [the documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html),\
    \ it's really worth it!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks again for your help! I'm having\
    \ trouble trying to convert this into Racket. I keep getting stuck on loops and\
    \ recursion. I appreciate your help once again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme\
    \ |>\nIf you can't figure out how to write that in Racket, here's a solution using\
    \ an immutable hash table and a hash function that returns the number of primes\
    \ less than a given number. \n<code>\n#lang racket\n\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define\
