    <|/ a tags=max,dynamic-programming,racket,algorithm |>\n<| c |>\nI thought that\
    \ using dynamic programming was the way to go, but I wasn't sure how to implement\
    \ it.  Thank you for the help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nGreat answer! But I would prefer\
    \ using list comprehensions instead of defining functions. But it is a nice trick\
    \ to see how it can be done even with a function.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYour code\
    \ is wrong for all test cases. Please correct it or give me the correct one.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=max,dynamic-programming,racket,algorithm |>\nYou would need\
    \ to know the maximum water that could be extracted from each well. Then, all\
    \ you need to do is loop through all wells until you have found the maximum water\
    \ that can fit in the first bucket. Then, just repeat the process for each well,\
    \ each time reducing the water in the bucket and adding it onto the maximum water\
    \ that can be extracted from the previous well. \nSo the algorithm would look\
    \ something like this: \n<code>\nint water = maxWater(Well* wells)\nfor(int i\
    \ = 0; i<numWells; i++)\n{\n   for(int j = i; j < numWells; j++)\n   {\n     \
    \ int maxWater = 0;\n      while(wells[i].canExtract(wells[j]))\n      {\n   \
    \      water -= wells[j].amountOfWater();\n         maxWater += wells[i].amountOfWater();\n\
    \      }\n      water += maxWater;\n   }\n}\nreturn water;\n</code>\nThe key part\
    \ is maxWater(Well* wells) where well is a structure that stores the amount of\
    \ water that can be extracted from each well and also the amount of water that\
    \ can be left in the bucket for each well. The function would just loop through\
    \ all the wells and calculate the maximum amount of water that can be extracted\
    \ in each bucket as seen in the code above.\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nWould\

    \ search, which means that it's O(log n), but it's still quadratic in practice.\
    \ So we could use more efficient algorithms if we wanted to.\nWe could actually\
    \ make this faster by using the fact that we can combine multiples of buckets\
    \ into the same bucket (since each bucket has capacity 1).\n\nExercise:\nWrite\
    \ a function find_bucket that takes a list of wells describing wells and returns\
    \ the bucket the well belongs to. For example:\n\n> (find_bucket '((1 2 3 4) (0\
