    \ need `cond` there. `if` is enough.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI thought about that,\
    \ but I'm more used to writing `cond` with multiple `then` clauses, not with `if`.\
    \ It's definitely a style issue though, since in this case `cond` just looks way\
    \ cleaner.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat style is called \"list syntax\". You are using\
    \ it all the time when `if` is used for `cond`. The only exception I can see is\
    \ the list syntax in `when`. Here you don't need to put parentheses around an\
    \ expression, which makes it easier to read and to write.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Oh, I see. I didn't realize you were using the `if` form to control the `cond`\
    \ clauses. I thought that was some sort of special `cond` form where you couldn't\
    \ just use `if`'s `then` clause with two other forms. I just learned something\
    \ new today. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, you can. With `cond` you can only\
    \ have one `then` clause that returns `#f` or `#t`. If you have multiple `if`'s\
    \ `then` clauses, you need to put them in parentheses like so: `(if <condition>\
    \ [then-clause] ...)`. In `cond` you can only have one `then` clause, whereas\
    \ with `if` you can use any number of forms. I find this style more readable than\
    \ using parentheses and list syntax. It also avoids mistakes like `[else [cond\
    \ ...]]`, where you may be unaware that `cond` can accept multiple forms.\n<|/\
