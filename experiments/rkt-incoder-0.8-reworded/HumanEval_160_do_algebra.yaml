    </code>\n<|/ a tags=scheme,racket,lisp |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. Although\
    \ I do not understand the meaning of the numbers you provided, I hope I understood\
    \ your solution properly. My problem is not with any particular numbers, but with\
    \ how I should go about creating this function. I don't know how to approach this\
    \ problem. I understand that I should create a function that takes a list as an\
    \ argument and returns the result of the operation. My problem is how to go about\
    \ actually making the function. I want to be able to pass in a list of basic algebra\
    \ operations and a second list of integers and have it return me a result of the\
    \ evaluation of the algebraic expression. I'm not even sure if this is right or\
    \ not.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see you've added a working solution and now you're\
    \ struggling with the basic idea of functions in general. Functions themselves\
    \ are extremely simple, but are usually passed around as arguments. `do_algebra`\
    \ is a function that takes a list as input and yields an output. `operator` and\
    \ `operand` are lists of symbols describing the operation (`+`, `*`, etc) and\
    \ the operands (`[2,3,4,5]`. So, `do_algebra` calls itself recursively until `operand`\
    \ is empty (it recurses down to the base case, which stops when the `operand`\
    \ is empty). You should be able to work this out from here and use your knowledge\
    \ about algebraic expressions to create a function to apply a specific operation\
    \ to an operand. Don't forget to accept this answer if it helps you!\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI've added an example of how you can use this to implement the function\
    \ `evaluate`, which applies a specific operation to a list of integers to yield\
    \ the result.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you very much! I was able to understand\
    \ and implement it in a very short time. My only issue was the understanding of\
    \ how to actually pass the function the lists. I didn't realize that I needed\
    \ to call the function with the lists I needed passed as an argument. Once again,\
    \ thank you very much for your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're very welcome.\
