    \ |>\nI agree with, but I'll post anyway.\nIn Haskell:\n<code>\nsolution' :: [Int]\
    \ -> Int\nsolution' = sum . filter ((>1) . (`mod` 2)) . dropWhile ((== 1) . length)\
    \ . tail\n</code>\nOr using tail instead of dropping the first element until we\
    \ reach the end.\nThe way this works is that dropWhile keeps going until it reaches\
    \ something that returns false. From the documentation:\n\ndropWhile p xs drops\
    \ elements while pred xs returns false; that is, it drops elements while pred\
    \ returns true for them.\n\nSo we're saying, keep going while length (drop xs)\
    \ is greater than 1. From the documentation:\n\nlength:: [a] -> Int\nThe length\
    \ of a list\n\nAnd then we're saying take the first element (drop xs) and only\
    \ keep odd elements (`mod` 2).\nAnd from there, it's just the sum of the odd elements.\
    \ And we're calling it like so:\n<code>\n$ ghci\n> solution' [5,8,7,1]\n12\n</code>\n\

    <| c |>\nI'm going to leave this up on hold for awhile but have you considered\
    \ the non-tail recursive version?  It is a lot simpler than my solution and it\
    \ takes less space than my tail recursive version by about a factor of two (it's\
    \ also much more readable than my solution because I have less repetition).\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI haven't considered it.  I'm just thinking about it.  Tail\
    \ recursion is so simple that it's unlikely I would want to write a non-tail recursive\
    \ version of it.  I suspect that it's likely to be faster than my tail recursive\
    \ version because the compiler will likely optimize tail recursion.\n<|/ c |>\n\

    \ works the same as the recursive solution.  A little simpler and more efficient.\n\

    \  That's why I said \"more readable\".  Your non-tail recursive version is simpler\

    \ to problems like these!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI feel like I'm missing something\
    \ very obvious here, but I don't see any `odd`s in the above code. Can you explain\
    \ how this works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: That code assumes it's been written with\
    \ `odd` in mind (which it is). It just adds it to `acc` if the current number\
    \ is even -- that's what the `if` clause does. If the code uses `odd` instead,\
    \ then it checks whether a given number is odd by looking at the remainder of\
    \ the division of the number by 2 (`modulo`). If it's 0, it's even. If it's 1,\
    \ it's odd.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I read that as `odd` being the same as `modulo\
    \ 2`, but your `if` doesn't match that assumption. `if` checks whether the number\
    \ is even. If it is even, it's added to the accumulator. If it's odd, it's ignored.\
    \ As soon as you flip it to `modulo`, the test becomes `modulo == 0` and everything\
    \ is fine.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Yeah, that makes more sense. Thanks.\n<|/ c |>\n\
