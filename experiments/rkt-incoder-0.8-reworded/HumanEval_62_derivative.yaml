    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=scheme |>\nThe definition of derivative in terms of the iterative\
    \ definition works well enough for polynomials, but for general functions you\
    \ may want something more general.\nThe usual definition of derivative requires\
    \ you to solve the equation for x. Then you subtract that solution from your function.\
    \ But if you have an equation for x, then all you need to do is subtract x^2 from\
    \ your function.\nSo how can we solve that equation for x? The answer is \"Differential\
    \ equation\" which you can solve using Sympy, which is an extension of Sympy that\
    \ has some derivative-solving capabilities.\n<code>\nfrom sympy import *\nfrom\
    \ sympy import Symbol\n\nx = Symbol('x')\nf = x**2 - 5\ndf = diff(f,x)\nx = solve(df)\n\
    </code>\nx will be a list of all solutions. But note that x will have a symbolic\
    \ form so you might need to use lambdify to turn it into a function that you can\
    \ call like this:\n<code>\nf = lambdify(x, f)\n</code>\nYou can then apply this\
    \ to any function by taking your function and subtracting the solution for each\
    \ element from your function, like this:\n<code>\n>>> f(x)\n0\n>>> f(x) - f(x**2)\n\
    0\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nNote that this only works for polynomials\
