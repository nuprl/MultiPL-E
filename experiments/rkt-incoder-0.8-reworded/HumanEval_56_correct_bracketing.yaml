    \ is that you should use an associative data structure. The first character of\
    \ a string is a good key. You can use a single hash table to store all the string\
    \ pairs starting with each key. Since the hash table has at most 26 entries, each\
    \ key can only store up to 26 entries. So you can have up to 26 hash tables storing\
    \ up to 26 string pairs.\n<code>\n#lang racket\n", "  (define stack (string->list\

    \ |>\nThe second is almost there, I think.  I think you meant `(< 0 <)`, though.\
    \  (I think the question is asking \"Does every opening bracket have a corresponding\
    \ closing bracket?\".  I think your `<>` test should return false on all three\
    \ examples; I think your `<<><>>` test returns true.)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're\
    \ absolutely correct, thank you for pointing that out. I've edited the answer\
    \ accordingly.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for looking at the problem and helping\

    \ very helpful.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme,lisp,pattern-matching dscore=2\
    \ |>\nI feel like you have a problem with parentheses, not brackets.  In Lisp\
    \ parlance, parentheses are used for grouping of expressions.  In Lisp parlance,\
    \ parentheses act as a grouping operator.  Thus, in Lisp, all parentheses are\
    \ grouping operators.  Thus, in Lisp, every opening parentheses has a corresponding\
    \ closing parentheses.  Thus, your examples are the correct ones.\nYou might also\
    \ want to read some books on Lisp.  Lisp is a very simple language.  You have\
    \ to know a lot of things.  You might be able to find a good textbook on Lisp.\
    \  There are plenty out there that teach Lisp.  The most important thing is to\
    \ learn what parentheses are about, and how they are used.  You'll also want to\
    \ use your favorite Lisp debugger to look at what your code is doing.  Think of\
    \ the Lisp as your \"program\" and how you use it as a \"program\".\n<|/ a |>\n\
    <| a tags=racket,scheme,lisp,pattern-matching |>\nThe code you wrote seems fine,\
    \ but your tests don't make any sense. Try (correct_bracketing '(< < >)) and see\
    \ what happens. Your test should be (< (length brackets) (length $+brackets)).\
    \ \nThe reason this is failing is because your test is only true if the number\
    \ of opening parentheses is exactly the same as the number of closing parentheses.\
    \ Because you don't have any parentheses inside of your test pattern, the test\
    \ will always return true.\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nI thought about that test\
    \ and I added `()` to the test and changed my test to `(< (length brackets) (",

    Hm, it's probably because the `correct` function takes a list and I'm calling\
    \ the `correct_bracketing` function on a string. I was confused by your `brackets`\
    \ variable. If you're looking for a function that will return a boolean value,\
    \ you'll have to convert the string to list first.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt works\
    \ fine for me. If you're still having issues, try pasting the code into DrRacket.\
    \ Having some trouble with the language interpreter, the code should be pasted\

    \ is actually a string of one character \"`#\\<`\"\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\n\
    Here's another solution that uses a stack to check each opening tag's closing\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=racket,scheme,racket-student-languages |>\n<| c |>\nThanks\
    \ for your great answer. It works great when there is only one correct bracket.\
    \ However when I try it with multiple correct brackets, it gives me the error\
    \ \"Wrong brackets found: (list \"<\" \">\")\". Do you have any suggestions?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added two examples with multiple correct brackets.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your response. I tried it with both examples and they\
    \ work. However I noticed that if you have two brackets that are correct but neither\
    \ of them is correct, it doesn't print anything. I added a example to my original\
