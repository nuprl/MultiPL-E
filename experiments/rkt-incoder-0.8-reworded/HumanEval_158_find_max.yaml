    \ of `\"a\"`. The second bug is that `hash-ref` always returns the same result\

    \ (which may be a bug, or not).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI didn't actually test it\

    \ I found the bug and a solution. There are two bugs in your solution. The first\
    \ one is that you used hash-set! instead of hash-set! when finding the new max\
    \ word. Since hash-set! is a macro and returns a list, your solutions actually\
    \ finds how many unique characters the current max word has and increments it\
    \ every time you find a word with a different unique character. The second bug\
    \ was that you didn't update the current max word when a unique character was\
    \ found. Thus you didn't get any max word at all. Here is how I fixed it:\n<code>",

    \ the solution to your problem is very simple: just put them in a hash, sort them\

    \ code would look like this:\n<code>", "  (define chars (string-map #(string %)\
