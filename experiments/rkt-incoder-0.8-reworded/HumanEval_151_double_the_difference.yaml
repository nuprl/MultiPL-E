    \ by Rainer Joswig is very helpful, but it does not solve the problem of how to\

    \ the list. You will have to create a separate function which takes the list as\
    \ input, and returns the sum of all the even numbers from the given list, but\
    \ since you also need to consume the list, your function will have to accept a\
    \ list as input and consume as output a list (or perhaps a vector), returning\
