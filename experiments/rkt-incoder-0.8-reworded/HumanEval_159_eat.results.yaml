    \ - I wish I could give more upvotes. I like the `modulo` function, I didn't know\
    \ that one. But I'm gonna keep my answer because it's easier to understand to\
    \ those who haven't learnt `let`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're probably right about\
    \ `let`, but it also means you need to be able to use it in other languages than\
    \ Racket, which is a really nice bonus. Also, I think your code is really difficult\
    \ to understand and it's probably not worth the time spent reading it until you\
    \ actually need it; it just makes the code much harder to read.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nI disagree with your statement that it's hard to understand. It's a good\
    \ example of how to use `let`. You can even see the pattern there.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYou might have to read that code a couple times before you see it. That\
    \ sounds like a lovely challenge. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nyeah, I think I might\
    \ actually have time to learn it, I like challenges. :) But I do like understanding\
    \ how to use it, since I like programming :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nI figured\
    \ out a solution. It uses only numbers and carrots. I hope it helps anyone.\n\

    \ you can see in the answer above, it's a relatively simple problem, yet we were\
    \ able to use recursion in order to solve it. You have also used the very powerful\
    \ cond function, which is a very powerful way to write if-then-else statements.\
    \ \nThe second conditional statement will check for how many carrots you have\
    \ left and how many you need to eat. If you have enough carrots to eat, you will\
    \ eat as many as you can. Otherwise, you will eat as many carrots as your number\
    \ variable indicates. \nThe first conditional statement will check if you have\
    \ enough carrots to eat. If you have not enough carrots, you will continue to\
    \ eat as many carrots as you need. \nOnce you are finished with your meal, you\
    \ just return an ordered list containing your number of carrots left and your\
    \ number of carrots need. \nIf at any point you have ran out of carrots to eat,\
    \ you will return the list with two zeroes.\n<|/ a tags=recursion,racket,scheme\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo problem. I really do love Scheme, it's a beautiful language.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt would be better if you used named lets and expressions instead\
    \ of nested conds. That would also allow you to remove the `else` clauses (which\
    \ would also be a big help).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks I really like the named\
    \ lets and expressions.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme dscore=0 |>\nThe code\
    \ you provided has a lot of redundancy and can make it hard to read and understand.\
    \ Consider refactoring your code to remove all the nested if/else clauses:\n<code>\n\

    \ (returns 11 4) (eat 4 8 9) (returns 12 1) (eat 1 10 10) (returns 11 0) (eat\

    \ (eat 6 10 10) (returns 7 11) (eat 10 10 10) (returns 0 11) are correct. Also\
    \ using my solution produces an incorrect output for large inputs as well. For\

    \ 10) (returns 0 11) whereas your solution (returns 4 12). I'm confused :/\n<|/\

    \ solution does not work for me. I have a program to print a hungry rabbit and\
    \ the program should accept the amount of carrots to eat and also the amount of\
    \ carrots left in the carrot bank. I am trying to use this to solve the problem\
    \ in the book called introduction to computing. Anyways, thanks for the help :)\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I see, the problem I see in your code is that you are using\
    \ the '=' operator instead of 'eq'. It should work fine now. If you have any troubles,\
    \ please feel free to ask.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI tried using 'eq' but the result\
    \ was the same. I'm pretty new to racket and I think that the problem is that\
    \ racket isn't recognizing that the \"(< remaining 0)\" part is correct. Is there\
    \ some kind of import to use that I am missing?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I don't\
    \ think so. The '=' operator is just an alias to the 'eq' function. You can always\
    \ check whether two values are equal using the 'eq' function. For example, if\
    \ you have two numbers 'a' and 'b', you can check if they are equal using the\
    \ 'eq' function: \n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let ((\

    \ c |>\nPlease see my answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/39542477/1193075)\
    \ for a solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme |>\nI'm sure you've heard\
    \ of Conway McQueen, who was a mathematician and physicist who were also a physicist.\
    \ He was involved in writing a bunch of computer programming languages and computers,\
    \ and he was one of the first people to write something similar to what you're\
    \ trying to do in his book. He was a fascinating little guy, and I wanted to have\
    \ a similar thing for myself. \nI couldn't find an exact duplicate, so I decided\
    \ to write my own interpreter, which is why I decided to use Racket. In fact,\
    \ I thought it would be a fun exercise to get into Racket as a beginner. \nSince\
    \ I haven't done Scheme in over 3 years (and I'm sure there's been a lot of improvement\
    \ since then), I'm sure someone will come along and criticize my use of Racket's\
    \ immutable variables. This was just my own way of implementing it, and I'm sure\
    \ someone will come along and criticize it, but it seemed like a fun way to learn.\n\
    I do have a few suggestions about your code. First, you're using an old version\
    \ of Scheme. I'd recommend using DrRacket or RacketCL if you're going to be learning\
    \ Scheme.\nSecond, instead of using cond for a long list of conditionals, I'd\
    \ recommend using an if expression. The difference between them is that if will\
    \ test the first argument to see if it's true or false. Cond will test every conditional.\
    \ If it finds one that's true, it will stop evaluating the rest. Using if can\
    \ help with readability and debugging. \nThird, your program could be greatly\
    \ improved by using the same variables over and over again. Instead of having\
    \ number be defined as 1, number could be defined as (carrots). Instead of having\
    \ carrots be defined as (carrots), you could have carrots be defined to (- carrots\
    \ (remaining-carrots)). \nFourth, I would recommend using list instead of cons\
    \ since cons is more \n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let\

    \ :) I don't think this counts the \"need\" carrots though, but I may be wrong.\
    \ I'll try and implement that part and see if I can get it to work. I'll post\
    \ my code here once I get it working :) Thanks again\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI've\
    \ implemented it and it works! (I made some slight changes and it still works).\
    \ Thanks for your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nThis seems like a good application\
    \ of a dynamic programming.\nA dynamic programming would allow you to store in\
    \ each cell (i,j) the count of eaten carrots.\nTo do so, we will use a table of\
    \ size 1000 x 1000 which will store the final results.\nThe main idea is to fill\
    \ in each cell from the previous one. \nFor each cell from (i-1,j) to (i+1,j)\
    \ we can compute the number of eaten carrots by incrementing number eaten by one\
    \ and decrementing the needed carrots by one (that is, we will always increment\
    \ the number of carrots and decrement the number of needed carrots).\nWe can compute\
    \ the number of carrots eaten in each cell by doing (number eaten) - (needed carrots).\n\
    The code should look something like this \n<code>\ndef eaten_carrots(i,j,number):\n\
    \    memo = [0] * 1000\n    memo[i][j] = number\n    if i>0 and j>0 and i!=1000\
    \ and j!=1000:\n        memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j] - (number - memo[i-2][j-1])\n\
    \    return memo[i-1][j]\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=scheme,racket,racket-student-language\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nWhat would be the syntax for this?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIn your\
    \ question you mention that you already have a function to count the number of\
    \ carrots eaten. Assuming you already have the function that counts the number\
    \ of carrots eaten, then you can use the function I provided to find the number\
    \ of carrots left to eat.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand the logic, but I don't\
    \ understand how the code would look like. I'm pretty new to coding in general.\
    \ Could you put this into a code block for me? I wouldn't mind looking at the\
    \ full code again \n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let\

    \ on DrRacket, and when I do `(take (+ number need) '(1 2 3))`, I'm getting `(define\
    \ (take x y) (if (< x 0) '() y))`, which is not what I'm expecting.  Any ideas?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nBy the way, I should probably clarify this -- I'm just trying\
    \ to write my own implementation in Scheme and DrRacket.  I appreciate your help!\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh that's a nice solution :)\n<|/ c |>\n\n(require rackunit)\n\

    \ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nWhy would you use a `cond` when the only cases are the\
    \ ones you already defined?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou might want to add some explanation.\
    \ `cond` just gives you a `list` of values, in this case `'()` or `'(...)`. It\
    \ has nothing to do with the recursion. Also, just use `if` instead of `cond`\
    \ here. If you don't know what `cond` does, then `cond` is probably not what you\
    \ want.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the answer. Although you guys are really\
    \ smart, and they did a really good job of explaining the concept, I will stick\
    \ with my method of writing my code using only `if` statements. I don't need `cond`\
    \ here, but it's good to know for future reference.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme\
    \ dscore=0 |>\nTo understand recursion, you need to remember that a function call\
    \ is like a step in the recursion. It starts with some arguments, and goes down\
    \ until it eventually reaches the base case. The base case is where the function\
    \ doesn't need to do anything further. The function call is like a step in the\
    \ recursion.\nIn your case, you want to write a function which eats one carrot.\
    \ We'll call that eat_one_carrot, and we pass in the number of carrots you have\
    \ already eaten into the function.\n<code>\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval)\

    \ how to implement this because I was working through a book using DrRacket which\
    \ had a lot of different functions (and different syntax) like cond and let. My\
    \ main confusion was that the book didn't really explain how these functions work\
    \ and what they did. Thank you very much.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for showing\
