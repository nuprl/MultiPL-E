    \ recursion. In order to understand the problem we need to break it down into\
    \ smaller steps. Once we understand that the first thing we need to do is count\
    \ the number of odd characters in a string. \nThe first thing we do is break the\
    \ string into characters. So we break our string into \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".\
    \ \nNext we count the number of \"b\" characters which is 1 so \"b\" is even and\
    \ our new string becomes (\"ab\"). \nNext we count the number of \"c\" characters\
    \ which is 1 so \"c\" is even and our new string becomes (\"abc\"). \nNext we\
    \ count the number of \"ab\" characters which are 3 so we add 3 to our count and\
    \ we get the answer 4. \nThis is the base case where we return the count which\
    \ is our answer. Now we start over and count the number of \"bc\" characters.\
    \ \n\"bc\" is even so our new string is (\"abcd\") and we count the number of\
    \ \"d\" characters which is 2 so we add 2 to our count and we get the answer 6.\
    \ \nNext we count the number of \"abc\" which is 7 so we add 7 to our count and\
    \ we get the answer 11.\n<|/ a dscore=2 tags=recursion,scheme,racket |>\n<| a\

    This is pretty smart. It's probably not very efficient on large lists since `odd?`\

    <| c |>\nThanks for the answer - I am just trying to understand how it works.\
    \ I see that the input list is mapped (fun (n) (str)) and that str is the current\
    \ element being checked - but how does the map know to check str? I see that n\
    \ is the current element being checked, which explains how it is O(n) - but I\
    \ don't see how it is O(n) because there is no way to check str to get the length\
    \ of it. Is that because n is being used?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`odd?` is being\
    \ called for every element in the list because it's being called once for each\

    \ Thanks for the explanation - I think I need to practice a bit more functional\
    \ programming.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`map` is basically a more complicated version\
    \ of `for` loops. `map` calls `(lambda (x) (f x))` on the elements of `lst` and\
    \ passes those values to `f`, where `f` applies the function. In this case, the\
    \ lambda is `odd?`, which checks if the current element of the list is a string\
    \ and if so returns the number of digits in the string. This results in a list\
    \ containing the number of digits in each string. `map` then passes these lists\
    \ to `odd?` and sums the results. If you think about it, this is the same as `odd?`\
    \ being called once for every string in `lst`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nFor anyone\

    \ be a little more idiomatically expressed as `(modulo (first lst) 2)` instead\
    \ of `(odd? (first lst))`.  Also, if you use `first` twice you can move the calls\
    \ to `first` outside the predicate as `(first lst)`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou probably\
    \ want your `cond` clause to include `(even? (first lst))` to be consistent with\

    \ more sense than `(odd? (first lst))` since you're looking to see if `lst` is\
    \ even (odd means even)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the comments. I edited\

    \ to make sure, no matter what we call it, that no matter how it is coded that\
    \ we can always tell what odd_count does. For example, (odd_count (list \"1234567\"\
    )) gives the same result as (odds (list \"1234567\")). Would this be possible?\
    \ And if so, I think it would be very useful!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat would be\
    \ possible, but you would have to modify the `odds` function to be able to accept\
    \ a list of strings. Is that what you mean by \"telling what `odd_count` does\"\
    ?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, something like that. I was thinking if we could say\
    \ that \"odd_count\" gives \"the number of the odd digits in each string in the\
    \ list\" (which is not quite the same thing as saying \"odd digits in the string\"\
    \ since it doesn't count the zero digit), we could possibly modify this code to\
    \ give the same results as \"odds\".\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAhh, I see. No, you can't\
    \ do this with `odd_count`. That's not possible. Maybe I misunderstood your original\
    \ request. Do you just want your function to take a list and spit out a list where\
    \ the ith element is the number of odd digits in element i? If that's the case,\
    \ then you should be able to do that easily. If not, maybe my answer can help\
    \ you out.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI guess my original request was unclear. Sorry\
    \ about that. Your answer is perfect, I just need to use it to my original request.\
