    The solution by Eli says it's wrong in many circumstances. \nFor example (monotonic\
    \ (list 1 2 4 20)) returns #t but (monotonic (list 2 1 4 20)) returns #f. I think\
    \ he meant to say that it's not the case that there is any element in the list\
    \ that is less than or equal to the element in the same position in reverse. So\
    \ it should be (monotonic (list 1 1 4 20)) #f and not (monotonic (list 2 1 4 20))\

    \ reflects the original solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,algorithm |>\nThe\
    \ code in the question does not work because when the car of an element in the\
    \ list is not greater than its cdr, it always returns #f. That means it does work\
    \ correctly only when the list is strictly decreasing. The solution of is correct,\
    \ but is just not as efficient as his code. Here is my solution which should work\
