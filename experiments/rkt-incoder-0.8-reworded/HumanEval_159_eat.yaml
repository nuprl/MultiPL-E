    \ you can see in the answer above, it's a relatively simple problem, yet we were\
    \ able to use recursion in order to solve it. You have also used the very powerful\
    \ cond function, which is a very powerful way to write if-then-else statements.\
    \ \nThe second conditional statement will check for how many carrots you have\
    \ left and how many you need to eat. If you have enough carrots to eat, you will\
    \ eat as many as you can. Otherwise, you will eat as many carrots as your number\
    \ variable indicates. \nThe first conditional statement will check if you have\
    \ enough carrots to eat. If you have not enough carrots, you will continue to\
    \ eat as many carrots as you need. \nOnce you are finished with your meal, you\
    \ just return an ordered list containing your number of carrots left and your\
    \ number of carrots need. \nIf at any point you have ran out of carrots to eat,\
    \ you will return the list with two zeroes.\n<|/ a tags=recursion,racket,scheme\

    \ for taking the time to review the problem. I've tried your code and it works\
    \ well for small inputs, but for large inputs it produces an incorrect answer\
    \ as you've pointed out. For example the inputs (eat 5 6 10) (returns 11 4) (eat\
    \ 4 8 9) (returns 12 1) (eat 1 10 10) (returns 11 0) (eat 2 11 5) (returns 7 0)\
    \ are all incorrect whereas (eat 5 5 10) (returns 4 12) (eat 6 10 10) (returns\
    \ 7 11) (eat 10 10 10) (returns 0 11) are correct. Also using my solution produces\
    \ an incorrect output for large inputs as well. For example (eat 5 5 10) (returns\
    \ 4 12) (eat 6 10 10) (returns 7 11) (eat 10 10 10) (returns 0 11) whereas your\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I see, the problem I see in your code is that you are using\

    \ some kind of import to use that I am missing?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: I don't\
    \ think so. The '=' operator is just an alias to the 'eq' function. You can always\

    <|/ a dscore=1 tags=racket,scheme |>\n<| c |>\nCan you please help me with the\
    \ procedure with variables?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nPlease see my answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/39542477/1193075)\
    \ for a solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme |>\nI'm sure you've heard\
    \ of Conway McQueen, who was a mathematician and physicist who were also a physicist.\
    \ He was involved in writing a bunch of computer programming languages and computers,\
    \ and he was one of the first people to write something similar to what you're\
    \ trying to do in his book. He was a fascinating little guy, and I wanted to have\
    \ a similar thing for myself. \nI couldn't find an exact duplicate, so I decided\
    \ to write my own interpreter, which is why I decided to use Racket. In fact,\
    \ I thought it would be a fun exercise to get into Racket as a beginner. \nSince\
    \ I haven't done Scheme in over 3 years (and I'm sure there's been a lot of improvement\
    \ since then), I'm sure someone will come along and criticize my use of Racket's\
    \ immutable variables. This was just my own way of implementing it, and I'm sure\
    \ someone will come along and criticize it, but it seemed like a fun way to learn.\n\
    I do have a few suggestions about your code. First, you're using an old version\
    \ of Scheme. I'd recommend using DrRacket or RacketCL if you're going to be learning\
    \ Scheme.\nSecond, instead of using cond for a long list of conditionals, I'd\
    \ recommend using an if expression. The difference between them is that if will\
    \ test the first argument to see if it's true or false. Cond will test every conditional.\
    \ If it finds one that's true, it will stop evaluating the rest. Using if can\
    \ help with readability and debugging. \nThird, your program could be greatly\
    \ improved by using the same variables over and over again. Instead of having\
    \ number be defined as 1, number could be defined as (carrots). Instead of having\
    \ carrots be defined as (carrots), you could have carrots be defined to (- carrots\
    \ (remaining-carrots)). \nFourth, I would recommend using list instead of cons\
    \ since cons is more ", "  (if (<= remaining 1000)\n      (if (<= need 1000)\n\

    \ of a dynamic programming.\nA dynamic programming would allow you to store in\
    \ each cell (i,j) the count of eaten carrots.\nTo do so, we will use a table of\
    \ size 1000 x 1000 which will store the final results.\nThe main idea is to fill\
    \ in each cell from the previous one. \nFor each cell from (i-1,j) to (i+1,j)\
    \ we can compute the number of eaten carrots by incrementing number eaten by one\
    \ and decrementing the needed carrots by one (that is, we will always increment\
    \ the number of carrots and decrement the number of needed carrots).\nWe can compute\
    \ the number of carrots eaten in each cell by doing (number eaten) - (needed carrots).\n\
    The code should look something like this \n<code>\ndef eaten_carrots(i,j,number):\n\
    \    memo = [0] * 1000\n    memo[i][j] = number\n    if i>0 and j>0 and i!=1000\
    \ and j!=1000:\n        memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j] - (number - memo[i-2][j-1])\n\
    \    return memo[i-1][j]\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=scheme,racket,racket-student-language\

    \ and number of carrots to eat for each day. The procedure should return a list\
    \ of possible solutions to the eat problem. For example, for the initial stock\

    \ should return (list 5 4) (list 5 4) (list 6 3). Note that the carrots left after\

    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nWhy would you use a `cond` when the only\
    \ cases are the ones you already defined?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou might want to\
    \ add some explanation. `cond` just gives you a `list` of values, in this case\
    \ `'()` or `'(...)`. It has nothing to do with the recursion. Also, just use `if`\
    \ instead of `cond` here. If you don't know what `cond` does, then `cond` is probably\
    \ not what you want.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the answer. Although you guys\
    \ are really smart, and they did a really good job of explaining the concept,\
    \ I will stick with my method of writing my code using only `if` statements. I\
    \ don't need `cond` here, but it's good to know for future reference.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a tags=racket,scheme dscore=0 |>\nTo understand recursion, you need to remember\
    \ that a function call is like a step in the recursion. It starts with some arguments,\
    \ and goes down until it eventually reaches the base case. The base case is where\
    \ the function doesn't need to do anything further. The function call is like\
    \ a step in the recursion.\nIn your case, you want to write a function which eats\
    \ one carrot. We'll call that eat_one_carrot, and we pass in the number of carrots\
