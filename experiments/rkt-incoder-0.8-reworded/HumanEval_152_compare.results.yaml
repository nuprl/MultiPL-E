    \ for your answer! So the problem is that the function returns `()`, not a list\

    \ the guess and the score when both numbers are less than 0 respectively?\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, because it's an anonymous function. `(define (calc-diff\
    \ score guess)...)` binds it's name to the function above. `(define foo (+ 1 1))`\
    \ creates a name `foo` and binds its value to `((lambda (score guess)...)`. So\
    \ it's really no different than `(+ 1 1)`. It's the same as `(let ((calc-diff\
    \ ...)) ...)`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see, I misunderstood how define works. Thanks\

    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThank you! I see what you're doing here.\
    \ I'm still struggling with it, but this gives me a little more to go on. I'll\
    \ let you know if I can solve this one.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis looks good, I\
    \ think I understand it. The only thing I'd change is I'd add another variable\
    \ (called \"best\"), and have it equal the first score. I would then take the\
    \ difference between this and the \"best\" variable. If that difference is bigger\
    \ than the difference, I set the best variable to this difference, and append\
    \ it to the guess list. Then, I would repeat this process, until all scores have\
    \ been compared.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited my post to include a proposed implementation.\
    \ Be sure to check it out and let me know if you have any questions!\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThank you! I looked at the code, and it definitely looks great. I'm having\
    \ trouble understanding how to apply it. I think I'm having trouble understanding\
    \ how it's getting the answer out of the procedure. How exactly would I call it\
    \ to get it to output a list? It would look like \"(compare (list 1 2 3 4 5 1)\
    \ (list 1 2 3 4 2 -2))\", but I'm not sure how to input the list into this code.\
    \ Do I add another \"(compare (list \" here?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou can put parentheses\
    \ around it like `(compare (list 1 2 3 4 5 1) (list 1 2 3 4 2 -2))` and it will\
    \ work. But you also have to give the function a name such as `compare`, or else\
    \ it will throw an error. If you are still having trouble, I recommend you look\
    \ at the chapter on defining procedures in Racket's Guide, which is probably the\
    \ most helpful guide I've seen.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI thought I would also post\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nHi Eric, thanks for your answer! I thought that my teacher wants\
    \ us to write a function like this one (compare game guess) that compares two\
    \ lists of scores, game and guess, as defined in the original post. The function\
    \ should compare the scores and return a list of numbers, where each number is\
    \ the difference between the two lists. The game and guess lists are guaranteed\
    \ to have equal lengths. I'm not sure if this answer is what you meant, but I\
    \ really appreciate your help with this!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYour function `compare`\
    \ looks like an exercise in recursion. In that case, your teacher may have intended\
    \ you to define a function `compare` that is supposed to act like a recursive\
    \ function (i.e. `compare` calls itself). I have edited my answer to show you\
    \ how your teacher's `compare` function would look in that case.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nThanks Eric! I will try to implement this!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nEric, thank\
    \ you so much! This is exactly what I was looking for. I implemented this and\
    \ it is working perfectly. Thank you so much for taking the time to write all\
    \ this out!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nI didn't spend much time on this problem,\
    \ but here is an implementation that doesn't use map, and is more straightforward.\n\
