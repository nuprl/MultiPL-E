    \ Can you explain to me the significance of the `do` loop here? I understand that\
    \ the first part is a nested loop that will loop through each number in the list\
    \ but I'm confused as to how `res` and `closest-number` are being set. Also, why\
    \ is the second `do` loop necessary?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe two loops are needed\
    \ so `res` and `closest-number` can be reset every time a new number is found.\
    \ So if `(let ((a b))... (set! c d)` is used, `a` and `b` will always be set for\
    \ the whole nested loop. On the other hand, `res` and `closest-number` need not\
    \ be reset because they are just \"pointers\" to where they should be when the\
    \ nested loop ends. To recap, `res` and `closest-number` can be thought ", " \
