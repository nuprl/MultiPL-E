    \ It works perfectly. But, I have another question, why do I have to initialize\
    \ the \"max\" value with 0? why can't it just be \"max\" instead of \"(max (max\
    \ lst))\" ?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`(max max)` is `(max (max max))` which is not\
    \ what you want. You **could** also use `(min max)` but that would also return\
    \ the min value from the input list. To fix it, I initialized max to -1 and use\
    \ `max` when updating the `max` variable.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme dscore=0\
    \ |>\nThis problem is similar to finding the max or min of an array in javascript.\
    \ It would be more efficient to use an algorithm which computes the min or max\
    \ once and stores it in a variable, then iterates through the array again to find\
    \ it.\n<|/ a |>\n<| a |>\n<code>", "  (let ([v (last lst)]\n        [f (frequency\

    \ |>\nThis solution uses the Racket language (#lang racket).  It uses a hash table\
    \ to track the frequency of each item in the input list.  (The first element of\
    \ the hash table will contain the value \"unchanged\" and the rest will contain\
    \ the frequencies of the input elements.  Thus, if the first element of the input\
    \ list is not in the hash table, that means we have not seen this element before.)\n\
    The solution uses a single recursive function, called frequency-reducer.  In general,\
    \ each recursive call reduces down to exactly two cases:\n\nThe frequency of the\
    \ current item in the input list minus the frequency of the item currently in\
    \ the hash table is greater than zero\n\nThat means that the new element is the\
    \ current item.  Otherwise, we have a new element that appears multiple times.\
    \  In order to do that, we can use a single recursive call.  That will give us\
    \ the final answer if and only if the input list contains no duplicates.\nHere's\
    \ the code:\n<code>", "  (cond\n    [(null? lst) '()]\n    [(< 1 (car lst)) (search\

    <| c |>\nI thought my answer was more intuitive and more understandable. My intuition\

    \ using recursion to solve the problem. Anyway, I edited my answer to hopefully\
    \ clarify what it is that I meant.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the great answer.\
    \ I think I was having a hard time understanding how \"frequencies\" worked. I'll\
    \ try and figure that out now.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nLet's look at your problem:\n\
    \nYou are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer\
    \ that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the\
    \ value of the integer itself. The frequency of an integer is the number of times\
    \ it appears in the list.\n\nYou seem to be saying that the frequency of an element\
    \ of the list is the count of how many times that element appears within your\
    \ list. Well, that's not quite right. If an element appears twice in the list,\
    \ then the frequency will be 2. That doesn't seem to match your description.\n\
    To get the frequency of an element of your list, you can make a helper function\
    \ like this:\n<code>", "  (let ((max -1)\n        (count 0))\n    (for ((i lst))\n\
    \      (if (> (car i) 0)\n          (set! max (car i))\n          (if (>= count\
    \ (car i))\n              (set! count (car i))\n              (set! max (car i)))))))\n\

    <| c |>\n`count` does exactly the same thing as `(count lst)` and is more efficient.\

    \ \nYou're going to need a function that will take a list and return the frequency\
    \ of each element. You'll also need a function to find the greatest element in\
    \ a list.\nThe frequency function would probably be easiest to write. I'll write\
    \ it in scheme since that's what I'm most familiar with (and it looks like it's\
