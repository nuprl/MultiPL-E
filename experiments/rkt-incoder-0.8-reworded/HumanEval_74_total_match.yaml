    \ |>\nThis is not a solution to the problem as stated in your question, but an\
    \ alternative solution that I thought of. \nThe problem you are trying to solve\
    \ has two parts:\n1.) Given two lists of strings, compare the length of the strings\
    \ in each list to the longest string in the other list. If they match, move to\
    \ the next element in the first list. If they don't match, move to the next element\
    \ in the second list.\n2.) Then compare the length of the strings in each list\
    \ to the longest string in the other list. If they match, move to the next element\
    \ in the first list. If they don't match, move to the next element in the second\
    \ list.\n3.) Continue this process until there are no more elements in the first\
    \ list.\nThe main challenge you are facing is coming up with the right algorithm\
    \ to compare the length of strings in the first list with the length of the strings\
    \ in the second list.\nThe solution I came up with is to create an algorithm that\
    \ compares the length of strings in the first list with the length of strings\
    \ in the second list until the length of the strings reaches the length of the\
    \ longest string in the second list.\nHere is my implementation of the above algorithm:\n\
