    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 tags=scheme,racket |>\n<| c |>\nIt would help a lot if\
    \ you could explain the algorithm for anyone trying to understand it\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI agree, but I think it's quite clear what it's doing. `numbers` can\
    \ be thought of as each number of the list and `remove_duplicates` returns a list\
    \ of all the numbers that occur only once. `(car numbers)` is the number that\
    \ appears only once in the original list `numbers`, otherwise it's `(car numbers)`\
    \ plus every number that appears more than once. `(cdr numbers)` is the rest of\
    \ the numbers in the original list that have not yet been handled.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nAh I see, so the algorithm is really \"if the list is empty, return it\"\
    ? Or \"If the first element of the list is the same as the second element, then\
    \ remove the first element and recurse with the rest of the list\"?\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nActually I think I've got it. I need to remember that I'm in Scheme.\
    \ `(cdr numbers)` returns the rest of the list without the first element. So `(car\
    \ numbers)` returns the first element and `(cdr numbers)` returns the second element\
    \ and so on. Then it recurses with the rest of the list, removing the first element\
    \ if the first element is equal to the second element in the list. Thanks!\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe general approach is to build a new list with all the numbers\
    \ from the original list that don't appear in the new list. \nYou can't do that\
    \ in constant time because you can't determine ahead of time what numbers will\
    \ or won't appear in the new list until you've finished the entire operation.\

    </cell>\n<text>\nThe for-expression is like a for loop in other programming languages:\
    \ it starts by evaluating the expression, looping over the values produced by\
    \ the expression, and then, each time the expression is evaluated, updating the\
    \ value of the loop variable. This variable is the last one in that list. Then,\
    \ the loop variable is bound to that value; we start by evaluating the expression\
    \ for the first time and set it to the value of the first loop variable, and then\
    \ evaluate the expression for the second time and set it to the value of the second\
    \ loop variable. In the second iteration of the loop, the expression evaluates\
    \ to the third loop variable, and the loop variable is bound to the value of the\
    \ third loop variable, and so on. Finally, the last expression evaluates to the\
    \ last loop variable, and that becomes the value of the final loop variable, and\
    \ we stop the loop. With this example, loop runs three times, and only stops when\
    \ its second loop variable is bound to a value less than the value of the second\
    \ loop variable.\n\nWithin a loop, each time we evaluate an expression, we create\
    \ a new fresh variable bound to that value. For example, in the first iteration\
    \ of the loop, number is the value of the first loop variable and counter is the\
    \ value of the second loop variable. The next time we evaluate (+ 1 counter),\
    \ the expression (+ 1 counter) evaluates to the value of the second loop variable,\
    \ but the value of counter is already set to 3, and so we have three different\
    \ variables bound to the same value.\n\nWhen we terminate a loop by evaluating\
    \ some expression, we set the value of the loop variable to some special value,\
    \ and exit the loop (by returning from the function). The loop variable is then\
    \ bound to the special value, and we loop to a new iteration of the loop.\n\n\
    The loop keyword is more general; we can call it any expression that evaluates\
    \ to a looping expression. For example, (loop for ...) is an expression that returns\
    \ a value. In a more general setting, the loop keyword can return any looping\
    \ expression value, including an infinite loop, an if statement, or a let. We\

    \ avoid adding an element if the element already exists in the list. The same\

    Because `(remove ...)` removes _all_ duplicates, not just those that occur more\
