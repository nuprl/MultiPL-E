    Nice solution! But it only works for a list of length 3, for arbitrary lengths\

    \ ... then ... else ...` but that's not correct. `(if (= 3 (length l)) (= (sum\

    \ 3.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme |>\nIn Racket, a list can be thought of\
    \ as a \"collection\" of numbers. Think of it like an algebraic data type.\nThe\
    \ most important property of a list is that it has no duplicate elements. A list\
    \ with 3 4's and 2's is still a list.\nA list with only one 4 is still a list.\
    \ A list with only 3's is a list. But a list with only 2's and 3's is not necessarily\
    \ a list.\nFor this reason, we can use filter to remove all elements in a list\
    \ which do not match a predicate. Since a list with no elements is a list, the\
    \ predicate we pass to filter is always true.\n<code>", "  (cond [(empty? l) #f]\n\

    \ how to solve this problem in terms of that function. To find an efficient algorithm\
    \ for this, you have to understand the following facts about your problem.\n\n\
    It is possible to show that there are two ways to sum up n numbers:\n\nAdding\
    \ them up\nSubtracting one from the other\n\nIt is possible to show that the sums\
    \ of two numbers are the sums of their respective products, and it is possible\
    \ to show that the sums of three numbers are the sums of their respective products,\
    \ and so on.\n\nHow do you prove that your function is correct? Well, that's quite\
    \ a difficult question, but let's start by proving that it is correct for the\
    \ case where you only have two numbers. To do that, let's look at the first number.\
    \ First, we need to prove that if you're adding together two numbers, then the\
    \ sum of the two numbers will be zero. So, let's do that. Well, let's look at\
    \ the product of those two numbers. Well, let's see what happens when we subtract\
    \ one from the other. Well, let's look at the product of the two numbers that\
    \ we subtracted one from. We don't need to subtract one from each of the original\
    \ two numbers individually. Since they are already different from the two original\
    \ numbers, they should cancel each other out. Since we know that each of the original\
    \ numbers is equal to the products of the original two numbers, we can take those\
    \ products out and add them up. So, let's do that. Well, what happens when we\
    \ add two numbers that we subtracted one from? Well, when we add two numbers that\
    \ we subtracted one from, we can see that one of the numbers is a negative number,\
    \ so let's subtract one from that number, so we're subtracting two numbers that\
    \ we subtracted one from each. Well, let's look at the product of the two numbers\
    \ that we subtracted one from that we can see that one number is negative and\
    \ the other is positive, so we should subtract one from that number so that we\
    \ can subtract the other from that number. We're doing this for the third number.\
    \ So, we can see that the sum of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the\
    \ three numbers that we subtracted one from each of their original numbers. And\
    \ the sum of the three numbers is the sum of the sums of the three numbers. So\
    \ if we multiply all the three numbers that we subtracted one from by the product\
    \ of the three numbers that we subtracted one from, then the sum of the three\
    \ numbers is the sum of the sums of the three numbers that we subtra", "  (let\

    \ (first l) 0) #t)\n    ((= (first l) -1) #f)\n    ((= (first l) -2) #t)\n   \
    \ (else (triples_sum_to_zero (rest l)))))\n</cell>\n<text>\nWe can see that the\
    \ definition of triples_sum_to_zero uses two basic control structures. First,\
    \ cond is a structure that takes a list of forms and a list of alternative forms.\
    \ It evaluates the first form (here only the first form) until it matches a condition,\
    \ then it evaluates the alternative forms. In the case of cond, the condition\
    \ is given by the (cond) expression, and the alternatives are given by a single\
    \ form that is in parentheses. For example, cond ((condition) (alternative)).\
    \ Second, we see an if expression. An if expression takes the form (if condition\
    \ then-form else-form). We see that there are two forms: then-form and else-form.\
    \ The condition and then-form are given by expressions separated by boolean operators.\
    \ Here we see that the condition is (= (first l) 0), which matches any list with\
    \ three elements. We then have two alternatives: #t or #f.\n\nThe first alternative\
    \ is #t. This means that the first element of the list matches. We see that there\
    \ is a conditional expression following the then-form: (= (first l) 0). The alternative\
    \ is #f. This means that the first element of the list does not match the conditional\
    \ expression. In this case, the entire list does not match the conditional expression,\
    \ which means that the first element of the list matches all the elements of the\
    \ list. Since the first element of the list matches all the elements of the list,\
    \ we have found a list with three distinct elements that sum to zero.\n\nThe second\
    \ alternative is #f. This means that the first element does not match the conditional\
    \ expression. So we can continue the recursion by evaluating the rest of the list.\
    \ In this case, the list doesn't contain any elements that match the conditional\
    \ expression, so the entire list matches. Therefore, triples_sum_to_zero returns\
    \ #t.\n\nWe can now see that our function works in all of these cases:\n\n\n</text>\n\
