    </code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nHi there, thank you very much for your answer. I like\
    \ the idea of using the 'fold' function. I am just trying to figure out how the\
    \ 'fold' function works.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSure. I'll try to put together some\
    \ examples for you, but you might want to take a look at some documentation to\
    \ get a feel for it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks again. I will take a look at some\
    \ documentation\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the example. I have been struggling\
    \ with how to apply 'fold' function but I think I understand it now.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 |>\nFor those who come here looking for how to solve this problem\
    \ in Haskell instead of Scheme, here is one way.\n<code>\nimport Data.List (foldl')\n\
    import Data.Maybe (fromJust)\n\n-- | Returns the difference between the two guesses\
    \ and the score.\nguess :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Maybe (Int, Int)\nguess guesses\
    \ scores =\n  foldl' (\\acc acc -> acc `seq` Just (fromJust acc, acc)) (head guesses,\
    \ head scores)\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=scheme,racket,algorithm |>\n<| c |>\nThanks\
    \ for your suggestion. I actually found another answer that does this in Haskell\
    \ but I have marked yours as correct as I like how you used the fold function.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nHere is another answer that I found on the Internet, written\
    \ in Scheme. It seems to work nicely and does what it says it does. But I am not\
    \ sure if it is the optimal solution.\n<code>\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval)\

    \ Fold() applies a function and two arguments to a list. The function is applied\
    \ to each element of the list and the next element of the list. The two arguments\
    \ that Fold() takes are an initial value (an accumulator) and an item (the current\
    \ element) of a list.\nTo solve this problem, we will use the fold procedure.\
    \ Fold() takes in a function that will be applied to each item in the list and\
    \ a list as arguments. The initial value will be the first element of the list,\
    \ and the accumulator will be the value of the function on the previous element\
    \ plus the value of the function on the next element. \nThis way, we will be able\
    \ to solve the problem by applying the fold procedure to the list [0 1 2 3 4 5]\
    \ and apply a function that computes the absolute difference between each item\

    </code>\nThe above code uses the #real->exact and #real->inexact macros from the\
    \ racket/format module. These macros tell Racket how to treat floating-point numbers.\
    \ Because the actual comparison of game against guess is done in a loop, the correct\
    \ number of decimal places needs to be known before starting the loop \u2014 otherwise\
    \ the difference may appear slightly different when comparing the first two answers.\
    \ Therefore, we need to use these macros.\nFinally, we use the let-values macro,\
    \ which lets you define multiple variables in a single expression.\n<|/ a tags=racket,scheme\

    \ dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for taking the time to write this out.  I didn't\
    \ know how to use map and lambdas this way, I looked it up and they were new to\
    \ me so I had no idea how to use them in this way.  I ran your program and it\
    \ seems to work correctly.  Thank you for your assistance.  I don't think I have\
    \ enough reputation to upvote you but it was helpful.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo problem.\
    \ As you can see from the comments, the trick is to think this through a bit and\
    \ make sure you understand the solution. Also, if you want other people to learn\
    \ Scheme and Racket together, you should probably follow the tutorial on [racket-tutorial.com](http://racket-tutorial.com)\
    \ first, and use the solutions provided there.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=racket,scheme\
    \ |>\nHere is my solution. It uses recursion and returns the distance between\
    \ the guess and the score. Since I am lazy, I did not try to optimize the code\
    \ much. \n<code>\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let ((\

    \ example, you have used nested conditionals and lists. I find that code very\
    \ hard to read, and in my opinion overkill. Instead, I recommend using an accumulator\
    \ to calculate the resulting scores. Using an accumulator also allows me to simplify\
    \ the conditionals within loop slightly, because I no longer need to use the length\
    \ function.\n<|/ a |>\n<| a |>\nThe question isn't very clear but I can understand\
    \ that it was given as a homework. You should use iteration to solve it. You should\
    \ write a function which takes two arguments and returns an array of length 2\
    \ where the first element is a score for correct guess and the second element\
    \ is a score for wrong guesses. The second element should be negative if the first\
    \ element is the wrong guess and the array should only have 2 elements.\n<|/ a\
    \ tags=racket,scheme dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nI edited the original post to include\
    \ a sample input. Also, how do you go about writing a recursive function that\
    \ takes two arguments?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI still don't see a pattern for how\
    \ to go about it. Are you familiar with recursion? The way you use it in a loop\
