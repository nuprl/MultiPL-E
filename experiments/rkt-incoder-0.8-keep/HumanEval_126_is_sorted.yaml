    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSure! Thanks for your answer!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI don't understand\
    \ your question. Which part of this homework are you struggling with? The sorting\
    \ or the removal? Can you explain more clearly?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI struggle\
    \ with the sorting part. Currently, I can only check if a list is sorted in ascending\
    \ order, which I did by going through it in a for loop and comparing each element\
    \ to its neighbor. My teacher wants me to use recursion to do this. I am stuck\
    \ on a recursive function because I am not completely sure how to go about sorting\
    \ it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWhen you say \"sorting\", do you mean ascending or descending?\
    \ If ascending, then you can just use `<`, if descending then `>`\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a |>\nThis can be solved using recursion, but recursion is a more advanced\
    \ technique and should be done only if it's required (for instance, in the case\
    \ of Scheme the use of recursion would often be replaced by an iteration). The\
    \ question asks for the use of recursion and I believe this solution is suitable\
    \ for the purpose.\nThe basic idea is to find the index of the last element that\
    \ is greater than the current element being considered. To do this, we recursively\
    \ find the index of the element that is greater than the element at index n and\
    \ compare it to the element at index n+1. If n+1 is the end of the list, the first\
    \ element is the last element greater than the current element, so the index is\
    \ equal to the length of the list (length). Otherwise, we compare the element\
    \ at index n with the element at index n+1 to determine which index comes first.\
    \ The result of this comparison is stored as the next index n.\nThe base case\
    \ of this function is that if the current element is the first element in the\
    \ list, it is the index of the last element in the list that is greater than the\
    \ current element. In the base case, the variable n holds the length of the list\
    \ minus 1.\n<code>", "  (cond\n    [(empty? lst) true]\n    [(equal? (first lst)\
