    \ |>\nThat `prime?` function is nice. Not sure why it would be the case that the\

    \ in the sentence, but anyway.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI assumed that would be the\
    \ case based on the problem statement. Since it seems that they want to print\

    <| c |>\nSorry for the misunderstanding. I meant \"is\" should also be returned\

    \ for the solution, I will try and implement it into my original program. I really\
    \ appreciate it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI edited my answer to return the word before\

    \ words. Just in case that wasn't clear, I'll also post the code that I used to\
    \ test this solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOk, I edited the original post to include\
    \ my code for the `prime?` function. Everything works properly except the one\
    \ line that begins with `(string-append (first words) (words_in_sentence (substring\
    \ sentence (length words)))` which returns the word with the highest prime number\
    \ in the sentence. I am not sure why. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank\

    \ it.  I didn't test the code above in racket but I was able to run it through\
    \ DrRacket.  It looks like the issue was that there was a space at the beginning\
    \ of the sentence and then the length was being counted with it.  I just updated\
    \ the code with the fixed version.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis fails on inputs \"\

    \ adding an initial space before the first word.  It seems Racket is counting\
    \ the first word as one and the first letter of the second word as 1 instead of\
    \ 1.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYour solution works. I tested it on the example provided\

    \ Thanks\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, it is. See the edited version of my post. In\
    \ a nutshell, instead of taking the first element of the list, I used `car`, which\
    \ gives the first element of the list, while not destructively mutating the list.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSorry for the late reply, but what does the car do? Is that\
    \ like the first element? Sorry for the questions, I am very new to scheme and\
    \ racket.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, the first element of a list is just `car`.\
    \ The `car` is just a shorthand for taking the first element of a list. So, in\
    \ your first `map`, you would have `car (split sentence)`, which would be the\
    \ first element of the list of words.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=scheme,racket,primes,racket-student-languages\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=racket,recursion |>\n<| c |>\nThanks this is awesome, could\
    \ you please explain what this line does though, `(char-at (first sentence) 0)(first\
    \ (rest sentence))` ?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's an alternative way of writing `(first\
    \ sentence)` which is more concise. `char-at` gives the character at the index\
    \ `0` from the beginning of the list, `first` gives the first element of the list,\
    \ and then `(first (rest sentence))` is equivalent to `(first sentence)`\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| a |>\nI came up with a solution that is O(n) time complexity, and O(n)\
    \ space complexity. Hope this helps.\n<code>\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval)\
