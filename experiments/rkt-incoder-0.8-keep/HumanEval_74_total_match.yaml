    That is quite beautiful. However you missed something important. Your solution\
    \ will return two lists if the two lists have the same number of chars. For example,\
    \ `'(1 2 3 4)` and `'(2 3 4 5)` will both return `(2 3 4 5)`. Also I think you\
    \ misread the question. Your function requires the lists to be in the same length,\
    \ but OP said \"return the first list if the number of chars in all strings are\
    \ equal\", which means it returns the longer of the two lists when they have the\
    \ same number of chars. His example is a good illustration of the problem.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're right. I misread the question. Fixed it now.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nOk, I think I understand now what you mean. The problem with your solution\
    \ is that the OP's `total_match` function has two separate lists which do not\
    \ need to be sorted. You only need to find out how many characters are in each\
    \ list, then sort them. I think you missed that when your function was returning\
    \ a list containing `total_match` itself, which is redundant information. I think\
    \ you probably meant to do `(fold-right (\u03BB (x y)\n                (append\
    \ (map char-length y) x))\n             lst1\n             lst2)` instead of `(fold-right\
    \ (\u03BB (x y)\n                (append (map char-length y) x))\n           \
    \  lst2\n             lst1)` as you did in your edited solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nI'm still a bit confused, but I think the problem is solved now. Thanks!\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI'm a little confused by this solution. Is it really returning\
    \ the longer list?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nHere is another solution based on counting\
    \ how many unique characters there are in each list. We use a helper function\
    \ which returns the length of each list, and a helper function which compares\
    \ two lists based on whether they have the same number of unique characters. \n\

    \ to show another way to think about it, that may come in handy if you're planning\
    \ on implementing other operations on strings and lists.\nStrings vs. Lists\n\
    In Racket, strings are immutable. Lists are mutable. Strings are created from\
    \ lists of characters using the string-set! function. Lists are created using\
    \ list: and list-append.\nIf you're looking to work with strings as you would\
    \ with a list, I suggest you use the string-set! function. If you want a list\
    \ that you can modify, I suggest you use the list: function which takes an argument\
    \ to create a list from a string and returns a list.\nThe difference between string-set!\
    \ and list: is that string-set! returns the modified string whereas list: returns\
    \ a list that can be modified.\nString Length vs. List Length\nAnother way to\
    \ think about strings is that they are lists that hold characters that you can\
    \ access by index. This makes it easy to create strings of any length you want.\
    \ While lists are more flexible and allow you to store different types of values\
    \ in them, strings are easier to work with.\nString Length\nIf you're looking\
    \ for a way to determine the length of a string, you can use the string-length\
    \ function. In Racket:\n<code>", "  (cond\n    [(empty? lst1) lst2]\n    [(empty?\
    \ lst2) lst1]\n    [(> (length lst1) (length lst2)) lst1]\n    [else lst2]\n \
    \ ))\n", "  (cond\n    [(empty? lst1)           lst2]\n    [(empty? lst2)    \

    \        [chars2 (car lst2)])\n        (if (< (length chars1) (length chars2))\n\
    \            (total_match (append chars1 (substring chars2 0 (- chars1 length)))\
    \ lst2)\n            (total_match (substring chars1 0 (- chars2 length)) lst1)))]))\n\
    </code>\n<|/ a tags=list,racket,scheme dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\n`total_match` has\
    \ a bug -- it returns `lst2` if `lst2` is shorter than `lst1`, when it should\
    \ be returning `lst1` when `lst1` is shorter than `lst2`.  It looks like you got\
    \ that one right on both cases, but there's a further one: it looks like this\
    \ solution would also return an empty list if `lst1` was an empty list.  I'm not\
    \ sure if that's correct or not, since it seems like a fairly unusual result,\
    \ but it could be a defect in how this function is supposed to work.  (Of course,\

    \ tags=racket,recursion |>\nThe problem is when you reach the end of the recursion.\
    \ At that point lst1 and lst2 are equal, which means that the cond clause of the\
    \ recursion will evaluate to true, and therefore the else clause will also evaluate\
    \ to true. Therefore, the final result will be the first list.\nI assume you meant\
    \ to have lst1 and lst2 be equal in length, so you can fix your problem by changing\
    \ the recursion condition to:\n<code>", "  (cond\n    [(empty? lst1) lst2]\n \
