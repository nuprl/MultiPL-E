    \ code is more readable and less error-prone. It uses fold which is a special\
    \ case of the reduce function found in many languages.\nThe code above uses the\
    \ following features:\n\nThe function f is curried which means that if called\
    \ with one argument it returns a new function which has two arguments. When you\
    \ call f with one argument, it returns a function that returns another function\
    \ which has one argument. Thus f can take in one argument and return a function\
    \ that takes one argument. Since this is what fold is doing, f can be easily curried.\n\
    Currying is not required in this example since only a single argument is used\
    \ but when working with functions with more than one argument, it is very handy.\n\
    fold can be thought of as combining two functions together in a certain way. The\
    \ first function is applied to every element in the list and returns a list containing\
    \ all the elements returned by that function. The second function is the function\
    \ that is applied to the previous results and the results are combined into a\
    \ single result using the fold. Here the previous results are an empty list and\
    \ the first function is applied and we get a list containing all the results.\n\
    In order to apply the function f to all the elements in the list xs we must use\
    \ the fold function. The first argument is the function to apply, the second argument\
    \ is an initial value, and the third argument is the list to apply the function\
    \ to.\nThe function f is applied to the elements of xs by using the fold function.\n\
    The function f returns a list of all the elements of xs multiplied by -1. Thus\
    \ this function is called on the elements of the list xs.\nThe list function returns\
    \ the list of the elements returned by applying the function f to the list xs.\n\
    \nThe result of the code above is as follows:\n<code>", "  (map (lambda (x) (*\
