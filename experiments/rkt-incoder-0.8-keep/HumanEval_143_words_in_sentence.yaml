    \ there is a way to get rid of the \"1\" and just have the numbers. Thanks\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, it is. See the edited version of my post. In a nutshell,\
    \ instead of taking the first element of the list, I used `car`, which gives the\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nSorry for the late reply, but what does the car do? Is that like\
    \ the first element? Sorry for the questions, I am very new to scheme and racket.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, the first element of a list is just `car`. The `car` is\
    \ just a shorthand for taking the first element of a list. So, in your first `map`,\
    \ you would have `car (split sentence)`, which would be the first element of the\
    \ list of words.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=scheme,racket,primes,racket-student-languages\
