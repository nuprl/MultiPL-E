    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 tags=racket,scheme,lisp |>\n<| c |>\nThis looks like a\
    \ bad approach. For two numbers you're comparing distances to each other, but\
    \ if the list has N numbers, you compare N^2 distances, which is N^2*N*N. As you\
    \ see, you're comparing each pair against every other pair which isn't too bad,\
    \ but it's an O(N^3) solution (N^2 comparisons). How many numbers are you going\
    \ to have this list of? How large will it be?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe list is\
    \ unlikely to be large at all. I'll have a few thousands of them before I start\

    <| a dscore=2 |>\nA simple way is to sort your list first, then check if there\
    \ are any duplicate elements - if so, there are two elements that are close to\
    \ each other - or if there are only two elements (which shouldn't be possible),\
    \ then they are just equidistant.\nSo I suggest you define a function called \"\
    closer\" that takes two elements and returns a value that is true if one element\
    \ is the \"closer\" than the other (meaning: they are equidistant), and false\
    \ otherwise. Then, define a function that \"checks if a list has equidistant elements\"\
    \ - and finally a function that \"checks if a list has two equidistant elements\"\
