    Okay, so I'm thinking about this a little bit, and I think it's worth a little\
    \ explanation. \nYour first problem statement is as follows:\n\nDetermine if a\
    \ list of numbers contains a negative number and a positive number\n\nSo, let's\
    \ look at your function. You have an initial condition that states that your list\
    \ of numbers are either empty or length 1. \nThen, inside of that function, your\
    \ condition states that if both lists are empty, then the answer is \"NO\". If\
    \ the first list has something other than a length-1 list, then the answer is\
    \ \"NO\". If the first list has only a length-1 list, the answer is \"YES\". \n\
    If all the above conditions hold true, then you have a list with positive and\
    \ negative numbers. Let's get to the real logic. \nThe first condition is \"NO\"\
    . Let's look at the rest of the conditions. The first condition is \"NO\". Since\
    \ your first list is empty (length 1), then no numbers are negative. Let's look\
    \ at the second condition. Since ", "  (let ([lst1 (sort-numbers-ascending lst1)])\n\

    The first step to fixing the OP's code would be to add the missing code in your\
    \ answer. Your code doesn't even use `exchange` anywhere in it. Also, the first\
    \ two cases are identical, so you can merge them into a single `cond`. Lastly,\
    \ you only need a single `cond` for the last case, so you could just write `(cond\
    \ [(equal? (exchange (cdr lst1) (car lst2)) (exchange lst1 lst2)) (equal? (exchange\
    \ (cdr lst2) (car lst1)) \"NO\") \"YES\"])`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with\

    <| c |>\nHi, welcome to SO. You'll need to provide some code of what you've already\
    \ tried, then we can help you with any errors/problems you may encounter.\n<|/\

    \ your help. I've added the code which I came up with so far. I've been struggling\

    \ please don't add comments like \"EDIT: ...\" or similar to the post - those\

    \ my problem by editing the code. The code I added doesn't have the comments but\
    \ it still doesn't look good.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme,lisp |>\nThis\
    \ is basically the same problem as https://stackoverflow.com/a/32507807/1565698,\
    \ but I wanted to answer it differently to show a different way to think about\
    \ the problem (although it can be solved with my answer, too).\nThe code you've\
    \ posted is too complex for me to read. One problem is that it mixes list representation\
    \ with logic that checks whether a list is empty. Another problem is that it mixes\
    \ list representation with list manipulation functions (length and car). If I\
    \ were you I'd try to separate things and make things simpler. It might sound\
    \ like a lot but once you get used to it it's really helpful.\nI made a simpler\
    \ version that uses only list manipulation functions:\n<code>", "  (cond\n   \
