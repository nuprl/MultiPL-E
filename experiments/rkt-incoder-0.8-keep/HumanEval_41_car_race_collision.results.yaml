    \ a dscore=2 tags=racket,lisp,scheme |>\nIt sounds like you're trying to write\

    The idea is that you have to consider each car and check if it collides with other\
    \ cars. You probably need a list data structure and for each car you check if\
    \ it collides with cars in the list.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThat's exactly what I'm\

    \ book - a racket program that can solve the car-race problem. I just finished\
    \ this one a few days ago, so I thought I would share it. I did it using racket\
    \ and scheme, so it should translate to pretty much any racket language you like.\
