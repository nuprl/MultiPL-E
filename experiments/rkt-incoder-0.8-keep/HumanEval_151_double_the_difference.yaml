    Hi Joshua, thank you so much for the response, but I'm really struggling with\
    \ how I'm supposed to use foldl here. I've edited my original post to show the\
    \ code I have so far, but I keep getting an error. Any help would be greatly appreciated\
    \ as I am very new to Racket (and programming in general).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Hi Joshua, I changed my code a bit and now it compiles, but I keep getting a very\
    \ large number when I run the code. I've been trying to figure out why and I keep\
    \ getting the wrong answer. Any chance you could take a look at my edited code?\
    \ Thanks so much!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOh, I just realized I needed to change `foldl\
    \ f 0 lst` into `foldl f 0 *lst*` since I'm only taking the sum of the squares.\
    \ Thank you so much for the help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYour answer is correct but\
    \ it has some errors.  Your code won't work for the input `'(1 (2 (3 4))) `. Also\
    \ your function doesn't return the sum of the squares.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHi\
    \ Joshua, yeah that was a typo. I changed it back to `'(1 (2 (3 4)))` and it still\
    \ works fine. The sum of the squares wasn't in the original question, but I added\
    \ it to the code after Joshua explained how to do it. Thanks so much for the help!\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nSo I rewrote the code, as per your last edit, and\
    \ I think I'm now getting the correct answer. However, I still keep getting a\
    \ large number as my output and I don't know why. I think it has something to\
    \ do with how I used foldl as I had originally written it, but I can't seem to\
    \ find my mistake. Thanks for all your help!\n<code>", "  (cond\n    [(empty?\
