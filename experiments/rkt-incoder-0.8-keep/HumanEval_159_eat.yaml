    \ Your code helped me a lot :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe solution is good, but you\
    \ didn't even mention the complexity. Since you're using tail recursion, the running\
    \ time of this algorithm is `O(m)`. It's worst case is `O(nm)`, which is exponential\
    \ complexity. The best case is `O(n)`, which is linear.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n,\
    \ you're right. I was thinking of a recursive solution, but you're right, using\
    \ a tail recursive solution would give better performance than an iterative one.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, thanks for the comment. Yes, I used the term 'complexity'\
    \ in my post a bit loosely. I meant that it is best to implement a tail recursive\
    \ solution, and that it would be better than an iterative one. In most cases,\
    \ a tail recursive solution is actually faster, because it avoids having to allocate\
    \ stack memory for the stack, and thus the memory requirement is lower in most\
    \ cases.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nHere is one possible implementation. This\
    \ solution is tail recursive so it will run in time O(nm).\nThe approach is to\
    \ consider two cases. \n\nThere are no carrots available so you return an empty\
    \ list.\nThere are at least 1 carrot, you use that and you return a list of carrots\
    \ left and the remaining carrots.\n\n<code>", "  (cond ((and (<= remaining 0)\

    \ Basically I created a variable \"total\" that is equal to \"need\" and every\
    \ time I go through the function I subtract \"need\" from \"total\" and add the\
    \ result to \"total\". At the end of the function I use \"total\" to return to\
    \ the main function. I hope this helps you. \n<code>", "  (cond ((= 0 number need)\n\

    <| c |>\nPlease don't use `(list* 0 0)`. That is a terrible idiom and should be\
    \ banned, as it is confusing and unnecessary. `null?` is a better test. Also,\
    \ `list*` is in fact a macro that takes two arguments. It is almost never a good\
    \ idea to use macros, since it makes the code confusing and unreadable.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nHmm, it's interesting that `(list* 0 0)` doesn't blow up.  I would\
    \ have expected it to fail at runtime.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, it's a macro,\
    \ and thus is unfortunate. Try `(define (foo x y) (list* x y))` and then `(foo\
    \ 1 2)`. You'll get `(1 2)`, which is not what you wanted. Of course, `(list*\
    \ x 0)` is always `(list x 0)`, but `(list* 0 x)` is always `'()`, and that's\
    \ not what you want. Maybe someone can fix this macro, because it seems a bit\
    \ awkward.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`(define (foo x y) (cons x y))` gives me `(1 2)`.\
    \ That's what I wanted. `null?` isn't a good test. It's a test of `null`, which\
    \ works with `null` but not with `(list 0 0)`. `null?` is useful, but it's not\
    \ really appropriate for testing the results of `list*`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    `(null? (list* 0 0))` is true, but `(null? (list 0 0))` is false. `(list* 0 0)`\
