    As for your original question, the main reason why your version isn't working\
    \ is because member's second argument is a set.  As stated in the documentation\
    \ for member:\n\nsublist must be a set; it cannot be a hash-table. If the sublist\
    \ has more elements than sublist-set, the remaining elements are ignored.\n\n\
    So the sublist you're passing is a set containing all of the numbers in your list,\
    \ but you're asking if any number is a member of the set, which clearly will always\
    \ return false.\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nOh thank you! I never thought of it like that.\
    \ I'll have to remember that for future reference. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks\
    \ again for your help. So I did have to change my code from (member (car l) seen))\
    \ to (member l seen)), and that works to get the unique numbers in my list. But\
    \ now I'm just wondering how I can sort them from lowest to highest. How would\
    \ I go about doing that? Thanks so much again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou want to\
    \ use [`sort`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Flist..rkt%29._sort%29%29):\
    \ `(sort (unique-sort '(5 3 5 2 3 3 9 0 123)))` returns `'(0 2 3 5 9 123)`. Note\
    \ that I changed `unique` to return a list, since you said you wanted a list of\
    \ unique numbers. If you instead wanted a set that contains only the unique numbers,\
    \ you should change the return value of `unique` to `set!`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Ahhh thank you! I didn't realize that unique didn't return a list :P And yes I\
    \ want a list containing only unique numbers. Thank you!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    No problem! `unique!` returns a list, so it's important to return a list rather\
    \ than a set! For your future reference, if you're working with sets, remember\
    \ that `set!` mutates its argument, but `unique!` doesn't! :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a\

    \ is very old but I've been wondering what your first snippet of code is doing.\
    \ I know it uses recursion but I'm not entirely sure why it's working that way,\
    \ can someone explain it to me please?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursion works\
    \ by taking a smaller list, processing it, and then recursively applying `loop`\
    \ to that smaller list. Once you've applied `loop` to a list it's done, so it\
    \ stops recursing, and the result is the concatenation of the list processed in\
    \ each iteration.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nThe solution above fails to work\
    \ in general because it uses remove!. remove! removes the first element that matches\
    \ the condition. For example, remove! removes the first element that matches (<\
    \ head tail) even though it matches (< head tail nil), so head is never updated.\

    \ has one major flaw - it does not guarantee ordering or that the values are unique.\
    \ If your list contains duplicate values, the solution will not work. E.g. `(unique\
    \ '(5 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5))` returns `(2 3 4 5)` instead of `(2 3 4 5)`. The `hash`\
    \ solution also only works if you're using a single hash bucket for all values,\
    \ and I thought it was important to point out that it's important to make sure\
    \ you have a single hash bucket for all values.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe hash solution\
