    How do you explain this? How can you explain this code? I am new to Scheme. :)\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis code iterates through the list twice, once with the first\
    \ element and once with the rest, and the first time it checks to see if the current\
    \ number is equal to the first element (the first time it runs). if it is not\
    \ the first element, it recursively runs through to remove the duplicates. This\
    \ makes the algorithm very efficient and efficient. Think of it as two for loops\
    \ in Java, or two while loops in C or C++.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your\
    \ explanation. So, I think we also need to check if the current number is equal\
    \ to the second element of the list, and if it is not, we need to check the next\
    \ element of the list for duplicates. Am I right?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes you\
    \ are right, each time the code is run it goes through all the elements in the\
    \ list once and checks the current element with the first. and then checks the\
    \ rest of the list with the rest. it does this until there are no more elements.\
    \ each time it checks the first element with the rest and removes it, then it\
    \ checks the rest with the first element and removes it. Then it checks the rest\
    \ of the list with the first element and removes it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks\

    Thank you very much! I did indeed forget that I was using Racket and did not have\
    \ remove-duplicates. I appreciate your help! One question though, since my professor\
    \ has told us to write our own functions, why are you recommending I not use Racket\
    \ specific functions? I know they are there for convenience, but are there any\
    \ disadvantages?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIf you don't need the function specifically,\
    \ you can just use an equivalent procedure in any other Scheme like `filter`.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nBy the way, Racket has `remove-duplicates`, just like you asked\
    \ in your question. `remove` is also an equivalent procedure in other Scheme implementations,\

    \ agree with you, but I just wanted to show that it is possible to write a function\

    \ will remove duplicates of a list regardless of its type (except for things like\
    \ `list` or `null?`, because those have to be removed). But then your example\
    \ won't work because `(list (list 1 2 3) (list 3 4 5))` becomes `(list (list 1\
    \ 2 3) (list 3 4 5))` instead of `((1 2 3) (3 4 5))`. So it's possible to write\
    \ a function that will take any kind of list and remove the duplicates.\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nIt would be nice if your function took two lists as parameters,\

    \ the answer you are looking for but since you asked for a different solution,\
