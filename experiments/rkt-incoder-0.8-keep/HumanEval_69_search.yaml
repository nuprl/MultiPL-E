    \ frequency value. The loop is called recursively, by calling the loop function\
    \ with the new element and the new list. For example: if the list is `[3, 1, 2,\
    \ 2, 1, 3, 2]`, the function will call it like this `(search 3 [4, 1, 2, 2, 3,\
    \ 1])` and then `((search 2 [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1])`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt will\
    \ go through all the elements in the list and find the highest frequency value,\
    \ which means it will loop through all the elements one by one, and then compare\
    \ it to the previous highest frequency value and if that value is higher than\
    \ the current highest frequency value, then it will replace the highest frequency\
    \ value. After the whole list is processed, the highest frequency value will be\
    \ returned to the calling function, which is usually the function `search`.\n\

    \ is fine, but I find it inconvenient that each time I call `loop` I pass an extra\

    \ to implement the helper procedure, which receives only the current state (`freq`\
    \ and `result`), and the initial state (`freq` equals to 0, `result` equals to\
    \ -1), and returns a list of three elements: `[freq, result, temp]`. See my [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45146625/849891)\

    \ wrote a helper procedure, called \"loop\", which receives a parameter called\
    \ 'i (which holds the current index in the list), and a parameter called 'n (which\
    \ holds the current frequency of the element). It returns a list of three elements:\
    \ the number of occurrences of 'n' (the element itself), the maximum number of\
    \ occurrences of 'n' (the element itself). The frequency of 'n' was decreased\
    \ by one, and the index of the element was increased by one. Here is the code:\n\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer! The thing that makes it easier to understand\
    \ for me is the use of the else keyword. Can you explain why the recursion stops\
    \ when the list is empty? That would help me to better understand recursion.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nBecause `(+ 1 x)` adds `x` to itself without changing it. So\
    \ `(+ 1 (search lst))` returns `(+ 1 (search lst))`, which is not `lst` anymore\
    \ and thus `search` returns `-1`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNote that this answer is\
    \ not tail recursive and can cause stack overflow for large lists.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nIf that's the case, then why do we have `cond` in `search`? And how do\
    \ we fix that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nA `cond` block is equivalent to `if`, so if\
    \ `(empty? lst)` is true, then `(+ 1 (search lst))` is equivalent to `(+ 1 (search\
    \ lst))`, which is not `lst` anymore and thus `(search lst)` returns `-1`. To\
    \ fix this, add `lst` at the end of the `(cond` block: `[else (+ (frequency-of(car\
    \ lst) lst) (search lst))]`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=recursion,scheme |>\n\
