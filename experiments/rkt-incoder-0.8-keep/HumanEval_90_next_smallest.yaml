    \ |>\n<| a |>\nThe standard solution for this problem would be to use a helper\
    \ function that takes two arguments: first element in the list and a pointer to\
    \ the current location in the list.\nThe second argument in the function is initialized\
    \ to zero and whenever you compare an element in the list with the first argument,\
    \ increment the pointer by the size of element and compare the element with the\
    \ next element in the list. When you get to the end of the list the pointer is\
    \ pointing to the end of the list. \nWhen the pointer reaches the end of the list\
    \ and the next element is also equal to the first element then the list had only\
    \ one element. Return this element as the next smallest element in the list.\n\
