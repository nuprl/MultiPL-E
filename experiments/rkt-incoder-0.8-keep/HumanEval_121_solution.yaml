    thank you for your help, would you mind explaining the loop part of this code?\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's a recursive function. It's a way to think about problems\
    \ in recursive form. You're defining a function `loop`. The first line says `(let\
    \ ((even-count 0) (odd-count 0))`. This defines the variables `even-count` and\
    \ `odd-count`. The next line says \"If `lst` is `nil`, return the `odd-count`;\
    \ otherwise, take the value at the front of the list `lst`; and if `x` is even\
    \ return the `loop` call with `even-count` incremented by 1 and `odd-count` incremented\
    \ by 1.\"\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAlso, in the body of the `loop` function, you can\

    \ within a given array of numbers. \nThe most obvious solution would be to find\
    \ the sum of the first and last elements of the given array and then subtract\
    \ the sum of all the odd elements from the last sum. This can be done by taking\

    <| c |>\nThank you so much for taking your time to answer my question!! It was\
    \ really helpful!! I hope you have a wonderful day.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOne final\
    \ question, how would you change the code so that it checks for the odd number\
    \ in the right position? That is, how would you make the program output the odd\
    \ element (in the position 1) instead of returning 0 for the input (30, 13, 24,\
    \ 321)? Thank you so much!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNo problem. As long as you understand\
    \ how this works, you can change it however you like. I would probably create\
    \ a helper function that returns the odd number in a position. I would then change\
    \ `solution` to call that function and add it to the sum when calculating odd\
    \ positions. You can see a working version [here](https://repl.it/@johnbeltravis/StickyDipstickstick).\
    \ Best of luck!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you so much again!! I have been trying\
    \ to understand the code but I can't for the life of me get it right. I keep getting\
    \ an infinite loop and I can't figure it out. Would you mind explaining what this\
    \ code is doing so I can try to implement it into my own code? I really appreciate\
    \ all your help :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWhat exactly are you having problems understanding?\n\
