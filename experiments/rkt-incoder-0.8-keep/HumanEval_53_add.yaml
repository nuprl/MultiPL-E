    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe other answer is better, my answer just explains how Racket's\
    \ \"named let\" works.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=scheme,racket,recursion |>\n\
    In Racket, the body of a named let is evaluated before the body of the parent\
    \ let, so the body of the parent let is evaluated before the body of the named\
    \ let:\n<code>", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ (* x x) (* y y)))\n", "  (+ (* x y) (*\
    \ (/ x y) y)))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ (* x x) (* y y)))\n", "  (+ x y))\n",
  "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", '  (+ x y))', "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", " \
    \ (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n",
  "  (+ (* x y) x))\n", "  (+ x y))\n</code>\nNow the second part involves defining\
    \ our own higher-order functions. You might have noticed that our add function\
    \ takes two numbers and returns their sum. We don't need that, we just need the\
    \ add function, to which we can pass our two numbers. A function that takes two\
    \ numbers and returns their sum can be written as:\n<code>", "  (+ x y))\n", " \
    \ (+ x y))\n", "  (if (< x y) \n      (+ x y)\n      (+ y x)))\n", "  (+ x y))\n",
  "  (+ x y))\n", "  (+ x y))\n", "  (if (= x 0) (+ y y) (+ x (+ x y)))))\n", "  (+\

    \ (+ (* x y) (* y x)))\n</cell>\n<text>\nThe Scheme programming language is also\
    \ a dialect of Scheme that allows us to write programs in imperative style. Scheme\u2019\
    s function language is very similar to Java\u2019s method language but with fewer\
    \ restrictions:\n\nNo methods. We call all functions procedures.\nNo static methods.\
    \ We call all methods functions.\nNo nested procedures. We must nest calls to\
    \ other procedures.\n\nThe last point is why some people prefer using Scheme in\
    \ lieu of Java. Scheme is a lot like Java and Java-like languages, such as Ruby,\
    \ Python, Perl, and PHP, are much more powerful and flexible than Scheme.\n\n\
    Scheme is a language designed for writing programs that solve problems. It has\
    \ both a style and a syntax that allows us to write programs that solve problems,\
    \ particularly problems whose solutions are complex and intricate.\n\nThe language\
    \ is designed to solve the problems described above. We can, for instance, solve\
    \ the problem of adding two numbers using the language above. But the language\
    \ is not restricted to solve the problems described above.\n\nThe language was\
    \ designed so that problems could be solved by writing a program in a way that\
    \ does not require many repetitions. And this makes the language easy to learn\
    \ and to write programs in.\n\nBut how can we solve problems when the problems\
    \ require many repetitions?\n\nOne way is to use the functional programming style\
    \ in which we define functions as first-class entities. For example, we can define\
    \ a function that adds two numbers using the add procedure:\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\n\

    <|/ a dscore=4 |>\n<| c |>\nHow does it answer the question?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The point was that one can rewrite the example in terms of `foldl` and `foldl1`,\
    \ just as in OP's original question.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWell, the point is that\
    \ `foldl1` isn't part of R5RS. OP already knows about `foldl`, so it should be\
    \ possible to use `foldl1` without needing to learn `foldl`. Not everyone does.\
    \ Just pointing out the possibility.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI guess the point is\
    \ not that it's impossible, but that \"no one does\", because every example they\
    \ can find is written using `foldl`. I added a note to the answer anyway.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe point is that OP already knows about `foldl`.  I suspect\
    \ that they were already familiar with it, and didn't realize they could use `(define\
    \ (add x y) (+ x y))` as part of the solution.  Perhaps they didn't know that\
    \ it was possible.  (Hence my comments about not needing to learn `foldl`.  And\
    \ that your answer has good reasons to use a functional library when available.)\n\
