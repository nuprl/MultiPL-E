    <|/ a tags=racket,algorithm,scheme |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for the response, I\
    \ think I understand how this works. I believe that I am having a little issue\
    \ understanding the first line. Why do you put #lang racket? Also, what does the\
    \ \"(count-unique (first words))\" do?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe racket language\
    \ is an extension to racket. Your code is using the functions from racket. [count-unique\
    \ is from racket/collect](https://docs.racket-lang.org/racket/collect-coll.html)\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nTo answer your question about why I put #lang racket, that\
    \ is just there to make it a complete program. If you replace it with a language\
    \ like python, it won't work.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe second question is not about\
    \ #lang racket, but rather, about the count-unique. How does this work? How do\
    \ you apply it to the list of words? I am still a little confused on this. Thank\
    \ you.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe function count-unique is from racket/collect. Look\
    \ at the link and read about the collection types in racket. Look up count-unique\
    \ and you should be able to find an explanation for it (or a solution).\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| a tags=racket,algorithm,scheme |>\nThis is my solution. There is an implementation\
    \ for count-unique that uses the hash table data structure as was suggested by\
    \ and here is a solution in Racket.\nThe hash table implementation is based on\
    \ this video: Hash Tables in Scheme. \n<code>\n#lang racket", "  (cond\n    ((null?\
