    \ some testing and it seems that your solution is more efficient than mine. My\
    \ solution took about 1.5 seconds to run while yours took about 0.3 seconds. I\
    \ guess this is because you used the each_with_index method which I didn't know\
    \ about. Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, `each_with_index` is very useful.\
    \ `each_with_index` iterates over an array and passes the current index and the\
    \ current element to the block. `index` is the current index and `score` is the\
    \ current element. `each_with_index` also takes care of incrementing the index\
    \ for you. `each_with_index` also takes care of decrementing the index for you.\
    \ `index` starts at `0` and increments by 1 for each element in the array. `score`\
    \ starts at `0` and increments by 1 for each element in the array. `index` starts\
    \ at `0` and decrements by 1 for each element in the array. `score` starts at\
    \ `0` and decrements by 1 for each element in the array. `index` starts at `1`\
    \ and increments by 1 for each element in the array. `score` starts at `1` and\
    \ increments by 1 for each element in the array. `index` starts at `1` and decrements\
    \ by 1 for each element in the array. `score` starts at `1` and decrements by\
    \ 1 for each element in the array. `index` starts at `2` and increments by 1 for\
    \ each element in the array. `score` starts at `2` and increments by 1 for each\
    \ element in the array. `index` starts at `2` and decrements by 1 for each element\
    \ in the array. `score` starts at `2` and decrements by 1 for each element in\
    \ the array.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added some explanation to the answer.\n<|/\
