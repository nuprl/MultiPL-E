    \ a\n    # period of time.  But then there will be no collisions until a catches\
    \ up to\n    # y, at which point, collisions will resume.  This is because x and\
    \ y are initially\n    # at a distance of b - y (and increasing!), so b will overtake\
    \ y before a catches up\n    # to x.\n    #\n    # More generally, if n == 1,\
    \ the answer is just n * n == 1.\n    # If n == 2, the answer is 2 * (1 + 1) ==\
    \ 4.\n    # If n == 3, the answer is 3 * (1 + 1 + 2) == 9.\n    # If n == 4, the\

    \ in the number of cars.\n    # It turns out, a linear solution is possible. \
    \ The key is to realize that the\n    # number of collisions where each set of\

    \ 2 pairs of cars in the first set, and n choose 2 pairs\n    # of cars in the\

    \ The next observation is that we can only pair cars of \"opposite\" speeds. \
