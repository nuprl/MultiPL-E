    \ odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture\
    \ in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with\
    \ any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term\
    \ as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n  \
    \  the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the\
    \ previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n,\
    \ the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n\
    \        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n  \
    \  get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8,\
    \ 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n\
    \    [1, 5]\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n  \
    \      return [1]\n    odd_list = [n]\n    while n != 1:\n        if n % 2 ==\
    \ 0:\n            n = n//2\n        else:\n            n = 3*n + 1\n        if\
    \ n % 2 != 0:\n            odd_list.append(n)\n    odd_list.sort()\n    return\
