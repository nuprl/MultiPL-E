    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer! I did a little bit\
    \ of research and found that my code was actually correct. I just had a problem\
    \ with the test cases. I didn't realize that I had to test the case where I only\
    \ had one carrot left. Thanks again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme |>\n<code>",
