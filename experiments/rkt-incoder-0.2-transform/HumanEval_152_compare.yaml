  \ shows a match. \n;; Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each\
  \ guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n;; the value is 0, and if not, the\
  \ value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n;; example:\n\

    \ still trying to understand how this works. I understand that you're using recursion\

    \ stops when `game` is `null`, which means there are no more elements to compare.\
    \ `(car game)` returns the first element in the list. `(cdr game)` returns the\
    \ rest of the list. `diff` takes the difference between the current element and\
    \ the first element. `diff` returns `0` if the current element is equal to the\
    \ first element, and `diff` returns the difference between the current element\
    \ and the rest of the list. `diff` is then added to the first element in the list,\
    \ which is returned by the recursive call.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAhh I see. So it\
