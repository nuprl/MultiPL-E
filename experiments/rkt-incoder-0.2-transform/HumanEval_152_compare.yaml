  \ is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n\
  ;; You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index\
  \ shows a match. \n;; Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each\
  \ guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n;; the value is 0, and if not, the\
  \ value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n;; example:\n\
  ;; >>> (compare (list 1 2 3 4 5 1) (list 1 2 3 4 2 -2))\n;; (list 0 0 0 0 3 3)\n\

    \ still trying to understand how this works. I understand that you're using recursion\
    \ to compare each element in the list with the first element in the list, but\
    \ how does it know to compare each element with the next element in the list?\
    \ Also, how does it know to compare each element with the next element in the\
    \ list until it reaches the end of the list?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursion\
    \ stops when `game` is `null`, which means there are no more elements to compare.\
    \ `(car game)` returns the first element in the list. `(cdr game)` returns the\
    \ rest of the list. `diff` takes the difference between the current element and\
    \ the first element. `diff` returns `0` if the current element is equal to the\
    \ first element, and `diff` returns the difference between the current element\
    \ and the rest of the list. `diff` is then added to the first element in the list,\
    \ which is returned by the recursive call.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAhh I see. So it\

    \ is that the function compare is recursive, meaning it calls itself with different\

    \ both lists. When you call it with four lists, it compares the first element\
    \ of both lists with the first element of both lists. When you call it with five\
    \ lists, it compares the first element of both lists with the first element of\
    \ both lists. When you call it with six lists, it compares the first element of\
    \ both lists with the first element of both lists. When you call it with seven\
    \ lists, it compares the first element of both lists with the first element of\
    \ both lists. When you call it with eight lists, it compares the first element\
    \ of both lists with the first element of both lists. When you call it with nine\
    \ lists, it compares the first element of both lists with the first element of\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=racket,scheme |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer! I understand\
    \ that my code was a bit too complicated and I should probably have used a recursive\
    \ function instead. My problem is that I cannot figure out how to implement the\
    \ recursive function without getting a stack overflow. I've tried a lot of different\
    \ things, but I always get stack overflows. I guess I should try and implement\
    \ the recursive function without using any loops. But I cannot figure out how\
    \ to do that either. Could you help me with that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added\
    \ my code to the original post. Could you please take a look at it?\n<|/ c |>\n\

    I solved it by using a recursive function and without using any loops. I guess\
    \ I should try and implement the recursive function without using any loops. But\

    Thanks so much for your help. I understand it a lot better now. One last question:\
    \ what is the purpose of the \"(define (compare game guess)\" line? I understand\
    \ that it's defining a function, but what is the purpose of that? I thought that\
    \ line was just defining a variable, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Thanks\
    \ again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe `define` statement is defining a function named\
    \ `compare` which takes two arguments. `game` and `guess` are arguments to the\
    \ function. `game` is the list of scores and `guess` is the list of guesses. `compare`\
    \ returns the list of differences between the two lists.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Ahh, I see. Thanks so much for all your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme\
    \ |>\nThe other answers here are great, but I thought I'd add my own answer because\
    \ I feel like it adds some extra information to what others have already said.\n\
    The way I see it, there are two ways to go about solving this problem:\n\nUse\
    \ a recursive function\nUse a tail recursive function\n\nThe first is probably\
    \ the easiest to understand, but I personally prefer the second because it's more\
    \ flexible and easier to understand.\nTail recursion is basically a function that\
    \ calls itself as soon as it has finished executing. This means that if you have\
    \ a function that calls itself multiple times (like your compare function), then\
    \ it can be called as a tail call, which means that it won't have to keep track\
    \ of all the intermediate calls and return them to the caller.\nTail recursion\
    \ is also known as tail call optimization, which means that it can sometimes be\
    \ faster than a recursive function because it doesn't have to keep track of all\
    \ the intermediate calls and return them to the caller.\nThe way I see it, tail ",

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe helper function is needed because you need a way to compare\
    \ the two lists. You can't just compare them directly. One way to do that is to\
    \ compare the first element of each list. Since the first element of each list\
    \ is the same, we can just compare the rest of the lists. I used a helper function\
    \ because I wanted to make the code more readable. Since you were using recursion,\
    \ I thought you were familiar with recursion. Recursion is very useful in many\
    \ situations. I hope this helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks so much for your help.\

    \ answer! I understand your solution, but I still don't understand how it works.\
    \ I understand that `compare` returns the difference between the two lists, but\
    \ I don't understand how it works. I understand that `diff` is calculated with\
    \ `(- guess (car game))`, but I don't understand how `diff` is used as the return\
    \ value of a recursive call. Could you please explain how `diff` is used as the\
    \ return value of a recursive call?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursive call `compare`\
    \ returns a list with the difference between the two guesses. `diff` is used as\
    \ the return value because it is returned by the recursive call. `diff` is then\
    \ used as the return value of the `compare` call in the `if` statement in the\
    \ `compare` function. The `if` statement is evaluated as `(equal? diff 0)` which\
    \ returns true if the difference between the two guesses is zero, otherwise it\
    \ returns false. `diff` is then used as the return value of the `compare` call\
    \ in the `if` statement in the `compare` function.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand\
