    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm still trying\
    \ to understand how this works. I understand that you're using recursion to compare\
    \ each element in the list with the first element in the list, but how does it\
    \ know to compare each element with the next element in the list? Also, how does\
    \ it know to compare each element with the next element in the list until it reaches\
    \ the end of the list?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursion stops when `game` is\
    \ `null`, which means there are no more elements to compare. `(car game)` returns\
    \ the first element in the list. `(cdr game)` returns the rest of the list. `diff`\
    \ takes the difference between the current element and the first element. `diff`\
    \ returns `0` if the current element is equal to the first element, and `diff`\
    \ returns the difference between the current element and the rest of the list.\
    \ `diff` is then added to the first element in the list, which is returned by\
    \ the recursive call.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAhh I see. So it compares each element\
    \ with the next element in the list until it reaches the end of the list. Thanks\
    \ for your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, that's right. `(car game)` returns the\
    \ first element in the list. `(cdr game)` returns the rest of the list. `diff`\
    \ takes the difference between the current element and the first element. `diff`\
    \ returns `0` if the current element is equal to the first element, and `diff`\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=racket,scheme |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer! I understand\
    \ that my code was a bit too complicated and I should probably have used a recursive\
    \ function instead. My problem is that I cannot figure out how to implement the\
    \ recursive function without getting a stack overflow. I've tried a lot of different\
    \ things, but I always get stack overflows. I guess I should try and implement\
    \ the recursive function without using any loops. But I cannot figure out how\
    \ to do that either. Could you help me with that?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added\
    \ my code to the original post. Could you please take a look at it?\n<|/ c |>\n\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=racket,scheme |>\n<| c |>\nI like your solution, but I believe\
    \ it can be simplified a bit. Instead of using `null?` you can just use `length`.\
    \ Also, instead of using `car` and `cdr` you can just use `first` and `rest`.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree, `length` would be a better choice. `first` and `rest`\

    \ ; recurse\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I think\
    \ I understand what you're saying, but I'm having trouble implementing it. Could\
    \ you please explain how I would go about implementing your solution? I'm very\
    \ new to Racket and I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nI added some comments to my answer. Hope it helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Thanks so much for your help. I understand it a lot better now. One last question:\
    \ what is the purpose of the \"(define (compare game guess)\" line? I understand\
    \ that it's defining a function, but what is the purpose of that? I thought that\
    \ line was just defining a variable, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Thanks\
    \ again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe `define` statement is defining a function named\
    \ `compare` which takes two arguments. `game` and `guess` are arguments to the\
    \ function. `game` is the list of scores and `guess` is the list of guesses. `compare`\
    \ returns the list of differences between the two lists.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Ahh, I see. Thanks so much for all your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=racket,scheme\
    \ |>\nThe other answers here are great, but I thought I'd add my own answer because\
    \ I feel like it adds some extra information to what others have already said.\n\
    The way I see it, there are two ways to go about solving this problem:\n\nUse\
    \ a recursive function\nUse a tail recursive function\n\nThe first is probably\
    \ the easiest to understand, but I personally prefer the second because it's more\
    \ flexible and easier to understand.\nTail recursion is basically a function that\
    \ calls itself as soon as it has finished executing. This means that if you have\
    \ a function that calls itself multiple times (like your compare function), then\
    \ it can be called as a tail call, which means that it won't have to keep track\
    \ of all the intermediate calls and return them to the caller.\nTail recursion\
    \ is also known as tail call optimization, which means that it can sometimes be\
    \ faster than a recursive function because it doesn't have to keep track of all\
    \ the intermediate calls and return them to the caller.\nThe way I see it, tail\

    \ I do have a question though. Why does your solution require a helper function?\
    \ I thought the problem was to compare the two lists given as parameters. I understand\
    \ that you're using recursion to compare the two lists, but why does it require\
    \ a helper function?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe helper function is needed because\
    \ you need a way to compare the two lists. You can't just compare them directly.\
    \ One way to do that is to compare the first element of each list. Since the first\
    \ element of each list is the same, we can just compare the rest of the lists.\
    \ I used a helper function because I wanted to make the code more readable. Since\
    \ you were using recursion, I thought you were familiar with recursion. Recursion\
    \ is very useful in many situations. I hope this helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks\

    \ answer! I understand your solution, but I still don't understand how it works.\
    \ I understand that `compare` returns the difference between the two lists, but\
    \ I don't understand how it works. I understand that `diff` is calculated with\
    \ `(- guess (car game))`, but I don't understand how `diff` is used as the return\
    \ value of a recursive call. Could you please explain how `diff` is used as the\
    \ return value of a recursive call?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursive call `compare`\
    \ returns a list with the difference between the two guesses. `diff` is used as\
    \ the return value because it is returned by the recursive call. `diff` is then\
    \ used as the return value of the `compare` call in the `if` statement in the\
    \ `compare` function. The `if` statement is evaluated as `(equal? diff 0)` which\
    \ returns true if the difference between the two guesses is zero, otherwise it\
    \ returns false. `diff` is then used as the return value of the `compare` call\
    \ in the `if` statement in the `compare` function.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand\
