    \ I'm having trouble understanding how it works. I understand that you're using\

    \ how it works. Can you explain how it works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe function\

    The `for` loop iterates over each cell in the grid. `i` and `j` are the current\

    \ `(i+1, j)`. The `if` statement checks if the current cell is the last cell in\
    \ the grid. If it is, then `i` and `j` have reached the end of the grid. Since\
    \ `i` and `j` have reached the end of the grid, `i` increases by 1 for each row\
