    </code>\n<|/ a tags=racket,scheme |>\n<| c |>\nI like your solution, but I wonder\
    \ why you use \"let\" instead of \"let*\" for the inner lets. I thought \"let\"\
    \ was more efficient than \"let*\", but maybe I'm wrong.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    `let` is more efficient than `let*` because `let*` creates a new scope for each\
    \ iteration, whereas `let` does not. `let*` also has the advantage of being able\
    \ to return multiple values, whereas `let` only returns one.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
