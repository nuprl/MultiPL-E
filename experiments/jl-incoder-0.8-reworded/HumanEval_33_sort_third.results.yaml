    \ are easier ways to do this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe OP wants the vector to be\
    \ sorted in place. There are simpler ways of doing that. I'd expect a beginner\
    \ to understand this code, which I did at the time. It was a fun exercise for\
    \ me to solve this problem.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes this is in place, it works,\
    \ and this one liner was actually something i was looking for thanks for the help.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis code is the answer, I was trying to recreate it in Julia\
    \ without using any prepackaged functions, but it got very complicated and I didnt\
    \ know how.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nIn order to do this in place, you would have to\
    \ copy the contents of the vector into a new vector, but then you would have to\
    \ sort it in place, which would require the copy to also be in place. Unfortunately,\
    \ this is not possible. \nThe best way to achieve this is to create another vector\
    \ of the same length and then do element-wise operations to update the elements\
    \ of the first vector from their sorted positions to the original position. \n\
    This can be done in Julia by writing a function that updates the first vector\
    \ in place based on the sorted indices of the second vector. Then, the first vector\
    \ could be passed as a parameter to the function as a reference:\n<code>\nusing\

    \ numbers and returns them sorted in descending order such that the first number\
    \ in the returned list is the biggest number in the list and the last number is\
    \ the smallest number in the list.\nNote that this problem is a little bit trickier\
    \ than the sorting problem you encountered before. Write the function out by hand!\
    \ The function should take the list as input parameter and return a vector with\
    \ the numbers sorted in descending order. Hint: use length() to find the length\
    \ of the list and index() to find the nth element of a list given the index from\
    \ 1 to length() of that list.\nHint: you will have to sort the list somehow. Start\
    \ by sorting the list that you initially provided; use sort_third() for the second\
    \ part, but this time using the list that you initially provided.\nExercise 10\n\
    Write a function called count_duplicates() that takes a list l and returns the\
    \ number of times each number appears in the list. Write it by hand! The function\
    \ should take a list of numbers as input parameter and return a list with the\
    \ number of times each number appears in the list as its elements. Hint: the function\
    \ should only iterate over the list once; it will have to make two passes over\
    \ the list.\nExercise 11\nWrite a function called count_duplicates() that takes\

    </code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nI'm confused by your code. Are you trying to sort\

    \ second is returning a vector of Int. Do you mean to sort Int or Int64? Your\
    \ function returns a vector of Int64 and my function returns a vector of Int.\
    \ Do you mean to sort Int64?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSorry,\nI wrote the above function\
    \ after posting my answer and I used the example I gave in my answer to test it.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOkay, cool. I just wanted to make sure it was clear that I\
    \ wrote it for Int64, not Int. I guess that's why I got a downvote. Thanks for\
    \ clearing that up. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI thought it was not clear at first.\
    \ But the point was to help people who want to sort a vector of Int64 as well\
    \ as Int.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=julia |>\nYou can do this using a sort function\
    \ and using isodd to check for even indexes.\n<code>\nsort(l::Vector{Int}, order::Symbol=:ascending)\
    \ = \n    sort(l, order) do i\n        mod(i,3) == 0\n    end\n</code>\nThis works\
    \ with both vectors and arrays. Note that you can also specify a comparison operator\
    \ using cmp argument.\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n<| c |>\nThe issue is that `isodd` checks\
    \ whether the index `i` is odd or even, but you need to compare it to the values\
    \ at odd indices. You would have to write a custom comparison function. But it's\
    \ easier to use `sort!` with the `by` argument instead: `sort!(l::Vector{Int},\
    \ order::Symbol=:ascending) where {T<:Ordered} = sort!(l, by=order, order::Symbol=:ascending)\
    \ do i; mod(i,3) == 0; end`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat's a good point. I haven't\

    \ faster. Recall that we were sorting the whole vector once for each call to sort_third.\
    \ This approach would require us to sort the whole vector several times rather\
    \ than sort it once and use every few elements to get the sorted version. On top\
    \ of this, we are also performing two integer division and one modulo operation\
    \ per element of l. However, since we are sorting a vector and since we want to\
    \ sort by increasing value, we could save on our modulo operation by using a binary\
    \ search to find the appropriate location in the sorted array.\nusing Test\n\n\

    <| a dscore=2 |>\nA few comments on your function:\nThe first thing that strikes\
    \ me is that the function signature is too restrictive. It does not specify the\
    \ type of the input, so the user could pass it any kind of iterable, and not only\
    \ arrays. You have to define your own functions to deal with arrays and non-arrays.\
    \ \nSecond, you do not return the sorted list, but just its length. \nThird, you\
    \ should use semicolons and indentation to increase readability. \nFourth, use\
    \ named constants for variable names. \nFifth, use underscores for function names.\
    \ \nSixth, you do not need to use semicolons at the end of a line in a Julia function.\n\
    Seventh, use Julia's built-in vectorization capabilities. \nEightth, read the\
    \ docs to learn the language's idiomatic ways of using it, and do not write convoluted\
    \ code. \nNinth, don't call a function sort_third. Instead, call it sort_third,\
    \ or something less generic like sort_third_or_whatever.\n<|/ a tags=julia,sorting\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\n\"Second, you do not return the sorted list, but just its length.\"\
    \nI think it's strange that the OP used this phrase as a way to emphasize that\
    \ he wants to sort the input vector and return the sorted one.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nYes, that is an important comment. I have edited my answer to reflect it.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=julia,sorting |>\nI think that you can improve the performance\
    \ quite a bit by using iterators over your input array and by precomputing certain\
    \ values (e.g. counts) rather than sorting each time. \nAlso, you can use the\
    \ built-in vectorization functionality to operate on the whole array in one go,\
    \ rather than the individual elements of it.\nHere's a modified version of your\
    \ code that does both:\n<code>\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = sort_third;\n\

    \ writing your own function.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added an example for you below\

    \ what the `[l[j], l[k]]` part means?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`l[j]` means \"element\
    \ `j` in the vector `l`, then `l[k]` means \"element `k` in the vector `l`, then\
    \ `l[j]` again means \"element `j` in the vector `l`\". The `l[j], l[k] = l[k],\
    \ l[j]` part is because we need to swap two values if the first one is larger,\

    \ and finally the fourth line fills the elements of l that correspond to these\
    \ indicies with their original values. In the end the function returns a vector\
    \ l that is the same as l except that the indicies where l is divisible by three\
    \ are sorted.\nHere is an example with a smaller vector (n=10):\n<code>\nsort_third(collect(0:0:n-10))\n\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI don't think that's right, since `sort` has O(nlogn) complexity\
    \ in the worst case. Your `sort_third` function doesn't work at all. If `l` is\
    \ sorted like `[1, 2, 3]` then `sort(l)` gives `[1,2,3]`, not `[1,2,3]`.\n<|/\

    \ definition of \"sorted\" as being \"in order\".\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, my definition\
    \ of \"sorted\" was incorrect. I meant that my function should return a vector\
    \ where each index except for the first and last is equal to the corresponding\
    \ value in the input vector except for those indicies that are divisible by 3.\
    \ For example, `l = [1,4,5,2,3]` should return `[1,2,3]`, but `l = [1,4,5,2,5]`\
    \ should return `[1,4,5,2,5]`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, also, I should also clarify\

    \ your approach, and it's helpful to see that it's possible to do without loops,\
    \ but I'm still unsure of how that would look like in Julia. The following is\
    \ what I thought would work, but it doesn't work because the function `sort` is\
    \ overloaded and returns a different type for `Int64` vs `Int`:\n`function sort_third(l::Vector{Int})\n\
