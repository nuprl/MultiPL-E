    \ a |>\n<| c |>\nI love this answer, but I think it could be made a little bit\
    \ more concise. Could you add some comments to explain what's going on? I think\
    \ this would be very useful for future visitors.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks so\
    \ much! This was really helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to help a noob\
    \ like me out.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI remember seeing an algorithm for this in\
    \ a textbook somewhere, but I forget exactly how it worked. Here's my take on\
    \ it:\nLet A[n] be an array of n integers that hold the number of carrots you\
    \ have eaten. Each index can hold either a carrots remaining or 0. If you encounter\
    \ an index that is 0, then you eat a carrot from that index (if that carrot is\
    \ not 0, you eat it from A[i] - 1) and decrement the carrot in the index to 1.\
    \ If it is 0, then you eat the carrot from A[i] and increment the carrot at A[i]\
    \ to 1 as you eat it. If you encounter an index A that is larger than n, then\
    \ you eat the carrots from the last index that is less than A[i], and set A[i]\
    \ to 0 to indicate that you no longer have enough carrots; you leave the last\
    \ index untouched.\nOnce you have finished adding up all the carrots, you can\
    \ go through each index in A and determine if there will be enough carrots left\
    \ to have enough to complete the day's meals. You can then go through each index\
    \ in A again to find out how many carrots there will be left if you have enough\
    \ carrots left.\nYou can go through each index in A only once (but you must have\
    \ enough carrots left to complete the day's meals).\n<|/ a dscore=2 tags=algorithm\

    No problem. If you have some time you can check out this tutorial on Julia's syntax\
    \ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4LcHgQJkK8&t=3m56s. Julia is a language for\
    \ linear algebra so it's very different than Matlab. Also, Julia has many cool\
    \ new features that Matlab does not, like broadcasting. Finally, Julia has good\
    \ documentation and it's very easy to learn and get up to speed.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
