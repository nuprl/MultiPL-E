    So I wrote a function anti_shuffle that takes a string and return a string where\

    \ based on ascii value.\nFor example: anti_shuffle(\"Hi\") = \"Hi\" ; anti_shuffle(\"\
    hello\") = \"ehllo\".\nFor this purpose, I wrote two functions. One that takes\
    \ the string and split it into an array (split_arr) and another function that\
    \ will sort this array (sort_arr).\nHere is the code for the functions:\n<code>",

    \ how it works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`[a+b | a<-s,b<-s]` loops over each character\
    \ in s and checks if it equals \"\" if it does then it returns \"\" (I believe\
    \ this is the same as `if a==\"\" then b else a`). On the other side `[a+b | a<-s,a==\"\
    \"]` loops over each character in s and checks if it equals \"\", if so then it\
    \ returns \"\". If it doesn't equal \"\" then it returns a+b. `reverse $ [a+b\
    \ | a<-s,b<-s]` takes the list of characters that we returned and reverts it.\n\

    \ to build a string with letters ordered according to their ascii value. This\
    \ can be achieved with the map function as follows:\n<code>\nmap(ord, x)\n</code>\n\
    where x is any string you want to get ordered (here \"Hi\").\nThis map function\
    \ returns a list of integers where each integer is the ascii value of the corresponding\
    \ letter. So, map will return the list [112, 113, 114, 115, 116] for the string\
    \ \"Hi\".\nThen you can use a list comprehension to order the list of numbers\
    \ in the order the way you want:\n<code>\n>>> [chr(i) for i in [1,2,3,4,5]]\n\
    ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']\n</code>\nNow you can join the result with an empty\
    \ string and you have the string with ordered letters:\n<code>\n>>> \"\".join([chr(i)\
    \ for i in [1,2,3,4,5]])\n'1234'\n</code>\nNow, to order the letters you want\
    \ you can use the reverse function:\n<code>\n>>> \"\".join(reversed([chr(i) for\
    \ i in [1,2,3,4,5]]))\n'53421'\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=string,swift,python dscore=4\

    \ to do this is to take each word and count it's occurrences, then build a new\
    \ list from the original one with the word with the highest count at the beginning,\
    \ then move on to the next word. \nIf you have a string like \"hello, hello, hello\"\
    \ it will look like \"hello, hello, hello\". Then just split it, count each word\
    \ and then append it to a new list until you hit the end of the list. \nThis would\
    \ only work if you had a list with two or lesser words and you wanted to preserve\
    \ the order of the original string. \nThe idea of counting the number of occurrences\

    \ this solution has some drawbacks and it's not the right way to solve this problem.\
    \ Let me explain what it does.\nThe idea of the algorithm is to find a suffix\
    \ tree (aka suffix array) for the string and to reconstruct it with the new order\
    \ of characters. It is possible to do it more efficiently than this, but this\
    \ will be much more complicated and hard to understand.\nWe assume that the string\
    \ to be processed is represented as an array of characters and that in ASCII it\
