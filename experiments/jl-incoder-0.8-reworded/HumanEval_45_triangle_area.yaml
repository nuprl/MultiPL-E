    \ is an exact solution to the question posted here. While it may not be the best\
    \ solution (I admit this was my first post). It solves the problem by using the\

    \ given the length of three sides and a base of 3 unit length. \nRecall the formula\
    \ for a triangle is $\\frac{4}{3}x^2 + a$. \nTo find the area of a triangle at\
    \ any base length, compute the product of the base length times the area of each\
    \ of three sides. \nFor example, for a triangle of base length (10, 5, 1), the\
    \ area is $10\\times 5\\times 1$ = 15. The area of a triangle at $2x_1$ is $5x_1^2\
    \ = 10$ times $5$ times $10$ times $1$ = 50. \nThe area of a triangle at $2x_3$\
    \ is $5x_3^2 = 10$ times $5$ times $10$ times $10$ times $2$ = 250.\nThe code\
    \ below will calculate the area of a triangle and return the result. \nNote, however,\
    \ that this code will only compute the area of a triangle that has a base length\
    \ of 3 or less. \nIf you need to compute the area of triangles with bases greater\
    \ than 3, you will need to add an additional conditional statement to \naccount\
    \ for bases greater than or equal to 3 before computing the area. \nThis code\
    \ should produce the same results as the code block below. \nYou may notice that\

    \ looking for something more compact. Something like ```def triangle_area(side1::Int64,\
    \ side2::Int64)::Float64 = side1 * side2 + side1 + side2 / 4```. As far as I understand\
    \ ```x + y``` isn't a standard mathematical formula, so I guess there is no way\
    \ to do it without using some function like ```sqrt```.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis\
    \ is indeed not standard mathematical formula, as stated in the other answer by\
    \ Vlad. I don't know why this question received so many downvotes, but I think\
    \ people should consider this as one of the great questions that comes up here\
    \ for everyone and should receive a lot of upvotes. If you don't understand why\
    \ this formula works it's because it's mathematical formula that works, but as\
    \ you say, it can't be expressed in standard mathematical notation.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nIt's definitely interesting. I was wondering why there wasn't a standard\
    \ mathematical formula for this, but I guess the answer is that there isn't one\
    \ and it's just not very useful (maybe just to make it a bit easier for people\
    \ to understand how it works). Also, the standard mathematical formulas don't\
    \ really work with my example because I only have x and y but in fact I actually\
    \ have side lengths. Anyways, thank you for answering the question. I'll just\
    \ stick with this implementation. I'm really glad I asked it here because now\
    \ that I know the answer, I'm gonna try to write my own function that does exactly\
    \ what I need. Thank you!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think this question may be a little\
    \ misguided by its name. It is asking about calculating the area of a triangle\

    \ solution, but I'm wondering why the function is written in Julia instead of\
    \ Python.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI'm new to Julia but my understanding is that Julia\
    \ is very similar to Python, so I figured it'd be easier to explain how functions\
    \ work in Python and then translate it over to Julia.  It's a good exercise though!\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think this is a nice solution for those who want to write\
    \ in pure Julia, but I think it can be made even faster if you use recursive calls:\
    \ just make a function `triangle_area(n)` that calculates `triangle_area(n-1)`\
    \ and `triangle_area(n-2)` separately and returns the sum of both. You'll need\
    \ something like `if n == 0 then 0 else` in the middle.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI\
    \ agree that this answer is the easiest to implement (and the fastest in practice),\
    \ but it is also less understandable (to me at least). I think it would be even\
    \ easier to use `if n % 2 == 0`, `else if n % 2 == 1`, `else throw(ArgumentError(\"\
    Triangle height must be even\"))` instead of `if` statements and `else if`s.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI didn't see you edit until I added my own answer. I agree\
    \ that it could be made more understandable, but I figured that if he was just\
    \ learning Julia this would be easier to understand. Regarding the speed of this\
    \ method, it's definitely not faster than my method (which also uses recursion),\
    \ and I think it's even less efficient.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThe other answers\
    \ here are great. My answer just expands on what they're doing and adds some explanation.\n\
    The concept of recursion is fairly straightforward, but can be hard to grasp at\
    \ first. If you're unfamiliar with how it works, I recommend you try it out for\
    \ yourself before using it in your code. Basically, a function calling a function\
    \ calling a function calling a function, etc. until it returns some result. That's\
    \ how functional programming works.\nLet's look at a simpler problem: you want\
    \ to make a function that takes a number n, adds 1 to it, then divides it by two.\
    \ Here's what that function might look like:\n<code>", "    if h == 0 \n    then\
    \ \n        1.0\n    elseif h > 0 \n    then \n        triangle_area(a+1, h-1)\
    \ + triangle_area(a+1, h-1) * (h-1)/2\n    else \n        triangle_area(a+1, h-1)\
    \ + triangle_area(a+1, h-1) * (h-1)/2\nend\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nI hope\
    \ you understand why your code doesn't work. :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree, your\

    \ compute `triangle_area()` recursively (instead of just providing the formula\
    \ for the area of a triangle). Also, the formula for computing the area of a triangle\
    \ is wrong. It should be `h^2/4` (instead of `h^2/2`). The formula for the area\
    \ of a square is `h*h/2`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nThere are lots of solutions in the\
    \ above posts, But my two cents worth while is this one.\nMy logic is simple.\
    \ We can divide this problem into two parts. First part is to find the area of\
    \ a trapezoid, and second part is to calculate the area of the parallelogram.\n\
    For the trapezoid part we can take the area of the triangle as its height/2 and\
    \ the width of the trapezoid as its width.\n<code>\ntrapezoid_area::Int64->Int64\n\
    trapezoid_area a = (0.5 * a * a) * ( 1 / 4 )\n</code>\nFor the parallelogram part\
    \ we can use the same formula as above but replace a with h. \n<code>\nparallelogram_area::Int64->Int64\n\
    parallelogram_area h = h^2/4\n</code>\nNow we can combine the two to find the\
    \ area of a parallelogram:\n<code>\narea_of_parallelogram::Int64->Int64\narea_of_parallelogram\
    \ h = h^2/4\narea_of_parallelogram a = trapezoid_area(h) + parallelogram_area(h)\n\
    </code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 tags=geometry,haskell |>\n<| a dscore=2 |>\nAs far as\
    \ I can tell, the other answers assume that the input values will only be two\
    \ positive integers (i.e. that the input will always be two integers), but they\
    \ also assume that the triangle is a perfect square. \nIf you wish to calculate\
    \ the area of a triangle that is not necessarily a perfect square, the following\
    \ code will work:\n<code>\n-- Input: Length of the side of the triangle (in Units\
    \ of Length)\n-- Output: Area of the triangle in Units of Area\ntriangle_area\

    \ things.\nOne option would be to write an ordinary function, like triangle_area\
    \ in your code:\n<code>", "    \n    # Write your code here\n    area = 0.\n \
    \   for i in 0...(a-h-1)\n        area += 1/math.pow(a+(i+h), 2)\n    return area\n\

    \ function to find maximum and minimum of a given list. Write the test cases for\

    \ I'm having some trouble with my code. I'm trying to write a function that calculates\
    \ the area of a triangle with given length and height and given base and height.\
    \ I've tried what you gave me but I keep getting an error that says:\n```The argument\
    \ of type \"Int64\" cannot be assigned to the parameter type \"Int\"```\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nYou're welcome. Would you mind taking a look at my edit?\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nI keep getting ```Method \"triangleArea\" not found.```\n<|/ c\
    \ |>\n<| c |>\nAre you using it with the `Area` function? If so that's where you\
    \ went wrong. `Area` is a function you created yourself with some of your code.\
    \ The `area_triangle` function was already created for you, so you just need to\
    \ pass it the length and height of the triangle as arguments. I've edited my answer\
    \ to show how you would use that function. Hope this helps!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Thank you! I'm still a little confused on how to get it to work. I'm still getting\
    \ the error ```The argument of type \"Int64\" cannot be assigned to the parameter\
    \ type \"Int\"``` when I try to call the function. I'm still trying to figure\
    \ out how to make it work. Thanks for the help :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=julia,python\
    \ |>\nHere's a Julia solution that may be helpful to you.  It's based on this\
    \ answer to a similar question, though the code below is more complete (it includes\
    \ the area of the triangle with given lengths and heights).\n<code>"]
