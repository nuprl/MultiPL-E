    It sounds like you want to sort by alphabetical order before grouping by the length\
    \ of the words. You could use the function sort_all to sort your vector, group_by\
    \ to group by the length of the words, and then collect the vectors that share\
    \ the same length:\n<code>\njulia> v1 = [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]\n[\"aa\", \"\
    a\", \"aaa\"]", "    \"\"\"\n    Sum a list of strings\n    \"\"\"\n    sum =\

    <| c |>\nThe question is asking how to do this in a functional manner as stated\
    \ above.  This answer does not attempt to do so (at least, not the way the question\
    \ is stated).  I believe the OP wants a `Vector{String}` rather than a `Vector{Int}`.\
    \  Therefore this answer is inappropriate.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think you missed\
    \ the part where he said 'The vector is always a vector of strings and never a\
    \ vector of numbers, and it may contain duplicates.' He also said that they may\
    \ have duplicates but he didn't say that the vector should be sorted by that rule.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nYou can do this by using the function split:\n<code>",
  "    vector = Vector{String}()\n    \n    for elem in lst\n        if (length(elem)\
    \ % 2 == 0)\n            push!(vector, elem)\n        end\n    end\n    return\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nIn haskell, `sort` is an O(n) operation, so the naive solution\
    \ would be O(n^2) for a large list.  The sort based solution would be O(n log\
    \ n).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nO(n) is the best case for sort, it sorts a list in O(n)\
    \ time\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSorting is not always `O(n log n)`. The standard `sort`\
    \ uses QuickSort, which has a worst-case `O(n\xB2)` complexity.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nIt would be a very bad solution to use the `length` function from your\
    \ first solution.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou have to compare the lengths somehow.\
    \ `length` can never be used directly because it doesn't have a fast implementation\
    \ in general as `foldl`. Thus I suggested an alternative solution that uses the\
    \ `length` function to solve the problem.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=3 |>\nHere's\
    \ a simple and naive implementation:\n<code>\ndeleteOdd :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]\n\
    deleteOdd xs = reverse $ sortBy cmp xs\n    where\n        cmp x y = fst x `cmp`\
    \ fst y\n</code>\nWe only need one comparison to sort, and we can assume it has\
    \ a fast implementation in general. Since we do not have access to an efficient\
    \ implementation of compare, we can not use sortBy directly. Instead, we need\
    \ to implement our own comparison function.\nLet's start with some benchmarking\

    \ to remember is that Julia sorts the elements of an array in place, meaning that\
    \ it modifies the original array. As such, the first thing we need to do is to\
    \ make a copy of the input array and sort that copy in place. Then, we need to\
    \ loop through the sorted copy to insert each element into a sorted array that\
    \ we will return.\n<code>", "    vect = Vector{String}(undef, 0)\n    for w in\
