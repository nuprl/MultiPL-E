    This code is basically a recursive implementation of the factorial function. I\

    \ O(n!). It's better to have a more direct and efficient implementation.\n<|/\

    \ than iterative ones. But I believe that most of the time, the iterative implementation\
    \ is faster than the recursive one. So if you're going to use recursive code in\
    \ practice for some reason, I'd suggest you do it with an iterative implementation.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: BTW, I'm pretty sure that Julia does already have a built-in\
    \ recursive factorial function, but I can't remember it right now. I think it's\
    \ `fact(n) = n*fact(n-1)`. Note that this only works if `n` isn't a complex number\
    \ (e.g. `factorial(1)` returns `1`)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nHere is another iterative\

    The factorial is a function that takes the argument n and gives you the product\

    <| c |>\nOk, so I have made a mistake in my question, because I meant f to return\

    \ for you. Btw, I'm not sure if your function is supposed to return a vector of\
    \ size n where each value is the factorial of n or it returns an integer with\
    \ the sum of the numbers from 1 to n. In the first case please consider what happens\
    \ with n = 0\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI do actually need it to be a vector of size\
    \ n. My question was too vague and I made a mistake in the question. f was supposed\
    \ to return a vector of size n where each value is the factorial of n or it returns\
    \ an integer with the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSo you\
    \ are actually saying that f should return a vector where each value is either\
    \ an Int with the factorial of n or it should be a Vector where each value is\

    \ c |>\nYes that is correct\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nIn your example, f returns a vector\
    \ of one element for each n. But in your comments you said you want it to return\
    \ a vector containing n elements. So I'm guessing you mean to do the following:",
  "    if n < 0\n        error(\"Factorial of negative numbers is not defined\")\n\

    \ for your answer. I tried to implement your code, but I'm getting an error. Maybe\
    \ it's because I'm running julia 1.5 on a server that doesn't support 1.4 functions?\
