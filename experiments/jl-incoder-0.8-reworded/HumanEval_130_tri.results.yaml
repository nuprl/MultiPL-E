    \ Fibonacci sequence?\n    A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers, starting\
    \ with 1, and \n    finishing with the number 1. The sequence starts with a 1,\
    \ \n    then 2, then 3, and so on. For example,\n    1, 3, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 \n\
    \    would have appeared as:\n    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 \n    Hence, the\
    \ Fibonacci sequence grows very quickly. \n    You have been tasked with finding\
    \ the first 10 numbers of the \n    Fibonacci sequence that result in a Fibonacci\
    \ number greater than 40000.\n    You will need to store all of the numbers in\
    \ an array and use \n    the function find to find the first 10 numbers in that\
    \ array that \n    result in a Fibonacci number greater than 40000.\n    Input\
    \ Format:\n    The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test\
    \ cases. \n    T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n.\n  \
    \  Constraints:\n    1 \u2264 T \u2264 500\n    -10\u2264 n \u2264 10\n    Output\
    \ Format:\n    For each test case, output one integer which is the first 10 numbers\
    \ of the \n    Fibonacci sequence that result in a Fibonacci number greater than\
    \ 40000.\n    Sample Input:\n    2\n    40000\n    Sample Output:\n    10 \n \
    \   33\n    Explanation: \n    The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence\
    \ that result in a Fibonacci \n    number greater than 40000 are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,\

    </code>\n<|/ a tags=fibonacci,sequence,julia |>\n<| c |>\nI think you might want\
    \ to add some explanation on what the code does and how it solves the question.\
    \ For example, a beginner might think `tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2)` means `tri(n)\
    \ = n + tri(n-1)` which would be wrong.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree. I updated\
    \ the answer. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2 |>\nUsing Julia 1.0:\n<code>\n\
    f(n, m::Int) = n >= m ? 1 : f(n, m - 1) + f(n, m - 2)\nf(n) = f(n, 5)\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a tags=fibonacci,sequence,julia |>\n<| a tags=fibonacci,sequence,julia |>\n\
    A version without recursive calls:\n<code>\nfib(n) = [1 1; 2 2; 3 3; 4 5; 5 8;\
    \ 6 13; 7 21; 8 34; 9 55; 10 89]\nfibonacci(n) = [fib(n+i) for i=1:5]\n</code>\n\
    <|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nThis should be the accepted answer. Recursion can\
    \ get expensive in Julia as it compiles the function every time it is called.\
    \ So if you have a problem with it, try using a different approach (iterative\
    \ or just manually calculating Fibonacci numbers).\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2 |>\n\

    \ at the same time he can not move out of the line.\nThe robot can not move backwards\
    \ or backward. He can move only forwards.\nThe robot can not move diagonally left\
    \ or right. He can move only left or right.\nHe can not move in a diagonal directions\
    \ except up and down.\nThe robot starts at the origin (0,0).\nThe robot can not\
    \ walk on itself.\nYou have to calculate how many possible paths the robot could\
    \ take given the current configuration, \nand the given direction (left,right,up,down).\n\
    A path is simply a series of moves made by the robot in the given direction.\n\
    Example:\nWhen we look at the right side of the robot starting at position (1,1),\
    \ the robot can moves to the right. \nThe robot first moves to the right and then\
    \ to the left at position (0,1). The robot can not move to the left at (1,1).\n\
    The robot can not move diagonally left or right. He can move only left or right.\n\
    He can not move in a diagonal directions except up and down.\nThe robot can move\
    \ only forwards.\nThere are two possible paths:\n(1,1),(1,0),(0,1),(0,0).\nThere\
    \ are 6 ways to reach the position (1,1) from the starting configuration (1,0).\
    \ The robot starts at the origin.\nThe robot can move to the right and to the\
    \ left at positions (1,1) and (1,0) respectively. \nThe robot can move diagonally\
    \ left or right. He can move only left or right.\nHe can move only forwards. \n\

    \ that doesn't really address the question.  It also shows what was already tried\

    \ update your answer to improve it?  Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=recursion,julia,iteration,function\
    \ |>\nThe first line in the function is a function declaration which declares\
    \ the function, not a call to the function. Here you can call the function by\
    \ putting the arguments inside the parenthesis. You can see the type of each of\
    \ the arguments below by typing function tri at the Julia prompt, or by typing\
    \ ?tri in the REPL environment. \n<code>\njulia> function tri(n::Int64)\n    \
    \     if n<=0\n            return zeros(0)\n         end\n         return ones(n-1)\
    \ + n/2 \n       end\n</code>\nThe second line is a definition of the function\
    \ tri, which takes the input n as an argument. Once the function is defined, you\
    \ use the return keyword to return the result. \n<code>\njulia> tri(5)\n5\xD7\
    1 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  2  3  4  5\n</code>\nNote that in the above example, the\
    \ return type is an array, but if all you wanted to do was print the result, you\
    \ would use the println function.\n<code>\njulia> tri(5)\n5\xD71 Array{Int64,2}:\n\
    \ 1  2  3  4  5\n</code>\nThe third line is a call to the function, which invokes\
    \ the function with the argument 5. Since you used the return keyword in the function\
    \ definition, the function returns the result you defined in the function definition.\
    \ \n<code>\njulia> tri(5)\n5\xD71 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  2  3  4  5\n</code>\nThe\
    \ fourth line is another definition of the function tri, but this time it is recursive.\
    \ Since you are using the return keyword in the function definition, the function\
    \ returns the result defined in the function definition. \n<code>\njulia> tri(5)\n\
    5\xD71 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  2  3  4  5\n</code>\nThe function definition is essentially\
    \ a way of defining functions that can recursively be applied to itself. \n<code>\n\

    \ close, but I suspected that it is because I used the `return` statement and\
    \ you used `push!` instead. I wonder what is the difference?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    , `return` returns the value at the moment it is called, `push!` adds the value\

    \ `Vector{Int64}([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])` before `tri(10) + tri(9) +\
    \ tri(8)` is executed. When you call `tri(10)`, then `tri(9)`, then `tri(8)`,\
    \ the function will immediately return `Vector{Int64}([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3,\
