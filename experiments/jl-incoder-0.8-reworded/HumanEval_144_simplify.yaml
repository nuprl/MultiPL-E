    \ to your question, but an alternative approach that may also be of interest.\n\
    A common way of implementing arithmetic expressions is to build a lexical parser\
    \ and then convert the parsed tree into an actual expression. One of the most\
    \ important things you can do is to make sure that every subexpression in the\
    \ expression tree is evaluated before any further subexpressions are evaluated\
    \ in the tree. For example, if you have two subexpressions such as 1/3 and 3 +\
    \ 3, your lexer will probably look something like this (written without testing\
    \ so this probably has some mistakes in it):\n<code>\nlex(expr, result)\n    if\
    \ expr[1] == \"+\"\n        lex(expr[2], result)\n        result[0] = result[0]\
    \ + result[2]\n        lex(expr[3], result)\n        result[0] = result[0] + result[3]\n\
    \    else if expr[1] == \"-\"\n        lex(expr[2], result)\n        result[0]\
    \ = result[0] - result[2]\n        lex(expr[3], result)\n        result[0] = result[0]\
    \ - result[3]\n    else if expr[1] == \"*\"\n        lex(expr[2], result)\n  \
    \      result[0] = result[0] * result[2]\n        lex(expr[3], result)\n     \
    \   result[0] = result[0] * result[3]\n    else if expr[1] == \"/\" and\n    \
    \    expr[2] == \"\"\n        result[0] = 1/result[3]\n    else\n        result[0]\
    \ = expr[1]\n    end\n</code>\nSo the idea is that you start with a base case,\
    \ and then the recursive cases. Each time you evaluate one part of the expression,\
    \ check if it's already been evaluated, and if it has then just return it.\nI\
    \ haven't tested this, but I think the code should work unless you encounter some\
    \ edge cases.\n<|/ a tags=recursion,julia,string |>\n<| a tags=recursion,julia,string\

    \ need the return keyword here: `if simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") println(\"true\"\
    ) else println(\"false\")` would have type `Unit`. Furthermore, `println` would\
    \ print to the console. So, `if simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") println(\"true\") else\
    \ println(\"false\")` would print `false` to the console if `false` is returned\
    \ by `simplify`\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nAlso, this function could be used like this:\

    <| c |>\nThank you for the answer, but that is not my question! My question is\
    \ about how to implement this function. I know how to implement basic functions\
    \ in Julia, but I have never made an entire function from scratch before in Julia.\
    \ My understanding is that I would have to first use split on the string, then\
    \ use eval to convert the string to a number. My problem is how exactly to implement\
    \ this function. I know how to make a function and how to input a string, but\
    \ how exactly do I implement this function. I know how to make a function using\
    \ split and eval, but I don't know how to implement this function!\n<|/ c |>\n\

    Your task should include to `return` `False` if the condition `x < n` is fulfilled.\
