prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive\
  \ integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the\
  \ range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\
  \n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n\
  \    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n\
  \    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n\
  \    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells\
  \ (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path\
  \ A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after making\
  \ the ordered vectors of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through (let's\
  \ call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than lst_B, in\
  \ other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such that lst_A[i]\
  \ < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It\
  \ is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n    Return an ordered vector of the\
  \ values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n\n    Examples:    \n \

    Thanks for answering, but I think you need to make some changes. Firstly, the\
    \ function should return a vector as your example does, not a single value. Secondly,\
    \ it should not be `Grid`. Thirdly, it should not be `grid` either, it should\
    \ just be `grid`. I have tried the code and it doesn't work correctly.\n<|/ c\

    \ takes care of the problem of finding the minimum of a given graph. We will have\
    \ a detailed discussion of the time complexity of various solutions in the following\
    \ sections.\nTime complexity of solutions\nThe above solutions have a time complexity\
    \ of O(k log k), where k is the length of the minimum path. Let's look at the\
    \ different cases when k is 2 or k is 1:\nk = 2\nIf k is 2, then there are two\
    \ possible paths that can reach the cells of the grid: one with length 1 and one\
    \ with length 2. Those two paths can be represented as a binary tree with each\
    \ level having a path length of 1 or 2, respectively. We can easily find the shortest\
    \ path from root to the deepest level in the binary tree by traversing from the\
    \ root to the deepest level and checking the path length. If the shortest path\
    \ length is 1, then we found a path which consists of only one node. This node\
    \ is our answer.\nk = 1\nIf k is 1, then there is only one possible path: the\
    \ path which consists of length 1, which is equal to the root node of the tree.\
    \ No matter what the path length is, there is only one possible answer. \nSolution\

    \ is specifically about the optimal solution, not a solution that takes O(n log\
    \ n). I suppose that means your implementation is wrong though, as it returns\
    \ wrong answer for some test cases.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n, you are right. Your\
    \ solution is wrong. See the example I added in the answer\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Yeah, I realized that after I added my solution, so I thought I'd update my post\
    \ to clarify this.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nHmmm. Doesn't work on the example `minPath([[5,\
    \ 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1)` though, although it does on `minPath([[1,\
    \ 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)`. Do you know why this is?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nThe algorithm gives you the shortest path. If you want the longest path\
    \ you need to change the `length(res - grid[i])` to `length(res - grid[i]) + length(grid[i])`.\
    \ I have updated my answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nI wrote a solution, which\
    \ is still not fast enough, but at least it works. I assume that all elements\
    \ are positive (which makes some differences, as I didn't handle this case). \n\
