    \ n `length`\n</code>\nNote that it is actually faster to check if a number is\
    \ prime by using this test:\n<code>\nisPrime :: (Integral a) => a -> Bool\nisPrime\
    \ n = n `mod` n == 0\n</code>\nThis is because division and mod are much more\

    \ explaining how this works though? I don't understand how it works even after\

    \ is better than the one mentioned in the answer by Rudolph\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Yes I realized that as soon as I posted my answer, but I wanted to share my thoughts.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt is not O(n), O(n^2) , it is O(nlogn)\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    No, it's definitely O(n*m), where m is the number of words in the original string.\
    \ Just check it out yourself in the HackerRank IDE :)\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=algorithm,python,dynamic-programming,string,data-structures\
    \ |>\n<code>\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    lens = map(len, sentence.split())\n\
    \    primes = filter(lambda x:x > 1, lens)\n    final = \"\"\n    for p in primes:\n\
    \        for x in range(p):\n            final = final + sentence.split()[x]\n\

    \ primes = []\n    for n in sorted_words:\n        if not n in primes:\n     \
