    \ tags=julia,arrays |>\nIn general, you cannot expect a linear transformation\
    \ to preserve the original distribution of numbers. That's because the transformed\
    \ numbers must add up to 1. Even if you choose to make the transformed numbers\
    \ sum to 1, if you chose to make it sum to 10 you cannot expect the numbers to\
    \ be exactly 10 from each other, because they are rounded to 10 when they are\
    \ converted to a float. So the linear transformation will not map them to the\
    \ same number.\nHowever, this won't be the case for most numbers that you might\
    \ want to transform. The distribution of numbers is likely skewed and skewed-normal\
    \ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewed-normal_distribution). For example, the\
    \ numbers [1, 2, 3] are quite skewed compared to the numbers [10, 2, 3]. Both\
    \ distributions have mean of 10 and variance of 2, so the mean of the transformed\
    \ numbers would be 10 while the original numbers are [10, 2, 3]. \nA good way\
    \ to solve this problem is to use a random sample. The random sample will give\
    \ you an approximate answer (mean = 0, variance = 1) for all numbers. If you want\
    \ the exact answer you can use the inverse of the transformation (divide each\
    \ element by 10).\n<|/ a |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nUsing Julia 1.5.3\n<code>\nusing\
