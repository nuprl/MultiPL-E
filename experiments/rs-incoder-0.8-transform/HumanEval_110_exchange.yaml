prompt: "/// In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of\
  \ numbers,\n/// and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of\
  \ elements\n/// between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n/// There\
  \ is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n/// If\
  \ it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n/// all\
  \ the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n/// Otherwise, return \"NO\"\
  .\n/// For example:\n/// >>> exchange(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], vec![1, 2, 3, 4])\n/// String::from(\"\
  YES\")\n/// >>> exchange(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], vec![1, 5, 3, 4])\n/// String::from(\"\
  NO\")\n/// It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\nfn exchange(lst1:\
