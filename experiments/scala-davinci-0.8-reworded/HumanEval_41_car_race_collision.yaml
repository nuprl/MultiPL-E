    \ if car i reaches a point x to the right of car j, and car j reaches\n      \
    \  // a point x to the left of car i.  Now, a car can reach point x to the right\
    \ of\n        // car j as soon as t minutes have passed since the start of the\
    \ race, where x\n        // is t times the speed of car i.  By the same token,\
    \ car j will reach point x\n        // to the left of car i as soon as s minutes\
    \ have passed, where x is s times the\n        // speed of car j.\n        //\
    \ So we have the following condition for the existence of a collision:\n     \
    \   // t * speed(i) = s * speed(j)\n        // Now, since speed(i) != speed(j),\
    \ we can take speed(i) as the independent variable.\n        // We can then take\
    \ s = t * speed(i) / speed(j).  This means that as soon as t minutes\n       \
    \ // have passed since the start of the race, car i reaches a point that's s *\
    \ speed(j)\n        // away from the starting point, which is the place where\
