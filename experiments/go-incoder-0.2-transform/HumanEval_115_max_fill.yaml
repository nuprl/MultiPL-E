    <text>\nGreat! Now you know how to use max_fill to solve the problem of filling\
    \ wells.\n\n\n</text>\n<text>\nPart 2: Backpack Search\nIn this part of the exercise,\
    \ you will write your own backpack search algorithm and use it to find the maximum\
    \ water level in a rectangular grid of wells. You will then use backpack search\
    \ to find the maximum water level in a rectangular grid of wells. You will then\
    \ use backpack search to find the maximum water level in a rectangular grid of\
    \ wells. You will then use backpack search to find the maximum water level in\
    \ a rectangular grid of wells.\n\nThe backpack search algorithm is as follows:\n\
    \nInitialize a list L of empty lists.\nFor each row in the grid:For each column\
    \ in the row:If grid[i][j] == 1, add i to the list L.\nIf grid[i][j] == 0, remove\
    \ i from the list L.\n\n\n\nReturn the maximum water level in the list L.\n\n\
    The code below is incomplete, but already includes the necessary parts to complete\
    \ the backpack search algorithm. Feel free to write additional code cells if you\
    \ get stuck.\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>\ndef backpackSearch(grid, capacity):\n    \"\

    </text>\n<text>\nProblem 7: 2D Water Fill\nLet's see how we can use max_fill to\
    \ fill a 2D grid of wells.\n\nThe grid is represented by a two-dimensional array.\
    \ \nThe first row represents the number of rows in the grid. \nThe first column\
    \ represents the number of columns in the grid. \nThe values in the grid represent\
    \ the number of units of water in a given cell. \nThe grid is indexed from 0 to\
    \ n-1 in the first row, and 0 to m-1 in the first column.\n\nThe 2D grid is represented\
    \ as a one-dimensional array of integers. \nThe integer represents the number\
    \ of units of water in a given cell. \nThe integer is indexed from 0 to n-1 in\
    \ the first row, and 0 to m-1 in the first column.\n\nExample:\n\ngrid = [[0,\
    \ 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]]\nThe above grid represents 3\
    \ rows and 3 columns of water.\n\nWrite a function that uses max_fill to fill\
    \ the 2D grid of wells represented by the one-dimensional array grid.\n\nThe function\
    \ should return an integer that represents the number of times that you need to\
    \ lower the buckets to empty the wells.\n\nThe function should return 0 when the\
    \ grid is empty.\n\nExample 1:\n\ngrid = [[0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0],\n   \
    \     [0, 0, 0]]\nThe above grid represents 3 rows and 3 columns of water.\n\n\
    max_fill(grid, 3)\nThe function should return 6 because you need to lower the\
    \ buckets to empty the wells.\n\nExplanation: \nThe first row has 3 units of water,\
    \ so the buckets should be empty.\nThe second row has 2 units of water, so the\
    \ buckets should be empty.\nThe third row has 1 units of water, so the buckets\
    \ should be empty.\nThe first column has 3 units of water, so the buckets should\
    \ be empty.\nThe second column has 2 units of water, so the buckets should be\
    \ empty.\nThe third column has 1 unit", "    m := make(map[int]int)\n    for _,\

    \ believe that your solution fails because you do not consider all possible combinations\
    \ of wells. For example, if you have 3 wells and 2 buckets, you only consider\
    \ 2 possible combinations:\n<code>\n[0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n</code>\nBut if you\
    \ have 4 wells and 3 buckets, you only consider 3 possible combinations:\n<code>\n\
    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 1]\n</code>\nThe solution\
    \ is simple - just add all possible combinations of wells to your solution:\n\
    <code>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint\
    \ max_fill(int grid[][2], int capacity) {\n    vector<int> solution;\n    \n \
    \   // Add all possible combinations of wells\n    for (int i = 0; i < capacity\
    \ - 1; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < capacity - 1; j++) {\n            for\
    \ (int k = 0; k < capacity - 1; k++) {\n                for (int l = 0; l < capacity\
    \ - 1; l++) {\n                    solution.push_back(grid[i][j] + grid[i][j +\
    \ 1] + grid[i + 1][j] + grid[i + 1][j + 1] + grid[i][k] + grid[i][k + 1] + grid[i\
    \ + 1][k] + grid[i + 1][k + 1]);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\
    \    }\n    \n    int max_so_far = INT_MIN;\n    \n    // Find max solution\n\
    \    for (int i = 0; i < solution.size(); i++) {\n        if (solution[i] > max_so_far)\
    \ {\n            max_so_far = solution[i];\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return\
    \ max_so_far;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int grid[][2] = {{0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0,\
    \ 0}, {1, 1, 1, 1}};\n    int capacity = 3;\n    \n    cout << max_fill(grid,\
    \ capacity) << endl;\n}\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your\
