  // The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The\n\
  // strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase\n\
  // letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters\
  \ \n// in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM.\

  \ format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\n// If there are two or more extensions\
  \ with the same strength, you should\n// choose the one that comes first in the\
  \ list.\n// For example, if you are given \"Slices\" as the class and a list of\
  \ the\n// extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should\n//\

    <|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I've tried your solution and\
    \ it works fine. However I still have some questions. I understand that your solution\
    \ works fine for small number of extensions. However, what if I have thousands\
    \ of extensions and I want to find the strongest one? I guess I should use some\
    \ kind of priority queue to find the strongest extension. Do you think my idea\
    \ is correct?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I think your idea is correct. Using a priority\
    \ queue would be a good idea. Another thing you could do is use a map to store\
    \ the extensions and their strengths. Then you could sort the map by strength\
    \ and get the strongest extension.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI've tried your solution\

    \ work if you have a class name with more than one uppercase letter. For example,\

    I fixed the bug in the code by adding another condition to the `if` statement\
