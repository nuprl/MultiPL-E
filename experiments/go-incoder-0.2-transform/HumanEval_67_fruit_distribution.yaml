    <| c |>\nThanks for your answer. I'm new to golang and I didn't know that we can\
    \ use strings.Split() to split a string into multiple strings. I thought that\
    \ we can only use strings.Split() to split a string into multiple strings when\
    \ we know how many strings are in the string. Thanks for your answer.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nYes, you can split a string into multiple strings. But if you don't know\
    \ how many strings are in the string, you cannot split it into multiple strings.\
    \ That's why I used `strings.Split()` in the first place.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Thanks for your answer. I think I understand it now.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\n<code>\n\
