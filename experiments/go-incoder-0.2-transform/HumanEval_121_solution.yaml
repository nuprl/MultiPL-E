    \ for your answer. Can you please explain how this works?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The `for` loop iterates over the `lst` slice, assigning each element to the `v`\
    \ variable. `v%2` checks if the element is even, and if it is, it adds it to the\
    \ sum. `v/2` does the same thing, but divides the number by two. `v/2` will always\
    \ round down, so the sum is always rounded down.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks. I\
