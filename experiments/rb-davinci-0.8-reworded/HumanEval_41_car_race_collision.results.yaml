    \ trick to use with Ruby's Enumerable's.\n    # If you are unfamiliar with Enumerables\
    \ in Ruby, you should go learn about them\n    # immediately by reading the Enumerable\
    \ documentation.\n    #\n    # Enumerable#map returns an Enumerable (usually an\
    \ Array) that contains the results\n    # of applying the block you provide to\
    \ each element of the original Enumerable.\n    #\n    # For example,\n    # [1,\
    \ 2, 3].map { |x| x * x }\n    # would return [1, 4, 9]\n    #\n    # In this\
    \ case, we are taking an array of integers, passing each of them as an\n    #\
    \ argument to a block that squares them, and returning an array of the results.\n\
    \    #\n    # When using the & operator, it is essential to think about the \"\
    shape\" of the\n    # data, and the shape of the function.\n    #\n    # In this\
    \ case, we have an array of integers, and we are passing them to a function\n\
    \    # that takes an integer, squares it, and returns the result.  As a result,\
    \ our\n    # map function can be replaced with the function that & is being passed.\n\
    \    #\n    # Note: map! is the \"bang\" version of map.  It performs the same\
    \ operation but in\n    # place.  However, the output of map! is no longer an\
    \ Enumerable; instead, it\n    # returns the object that was operated on.  Since\
    \ our output has no Enumerable\n    # operations on it, we can safely use the\
    \ bang version of map.\n    #\n    # Finally, we are using the count function,\
    \ which is similar to the length function.\n    # The difference is that count\
    \ takes an argument, a block, and only counts the number\n    # of elements that\
    \ return true when passed to that block.\n    #\n    # For example, if you have\
    \ an array of integers, and you want to count how many of\n    # them are even,\
    \ you can use count.\n    #\n    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].count { |x| x.even? }\n   \
