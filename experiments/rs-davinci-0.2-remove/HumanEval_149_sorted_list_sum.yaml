prompt: "/// Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n///\
  \ deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n/// and returns the resulted\
  \ list with a sorted order,\n/// The list is always a list of strings and never\
  \ an array of numbers,\n/// and it may contain duplicates.\n/// The order of the\
  \ list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n/// should return the\
  \ list sorted by that rule.\n/// If two words have the same length, sort the list\
  \ alphabetically.\n/// The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n\
  /// You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n/// For example:\n\
  fn sorted_list_sum(lst: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {\n"
