prompt: "/// You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert\
  \ it to\n/// binary format. The function should return a string, with each character\
  \ representing a binary\n/// number. Each character in the string will be '0' or\
  \ '1'.\n/// There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and\
  \ at the end of the string.\n/// The extra characters are there to help with the\
  \ format.\n/// Examples:\nfn decimal_to_binary(decimal: isize) -> String {\n"
