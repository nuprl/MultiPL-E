  \ a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes\n    your task is to pluck\
  \ one of the nodes and return it.\n    The plucked node should be the node with\
  \ the smallest even value.\n    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value\
  \ are found return the node that has smallest index.\n\n    The plucked node should\
  \ be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],\n    If there are no even\
  \ values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\n    Example 1:\n    >>> pluck([4L,\
  \ 2L, 3L])\n    [2L, 1L]\n    Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2\
  \ has the smallest index.\n\n    Example 2:\n    >>> pluck([1L, 2L, 3L])\n    [2L,\
  \ 1L]\n    Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\
  \n    Example 3:\n    >>> pluck([])\n    []\n    \n    Example 4:\n    >>> pluck([5L,\
  \ 0L, 3L, 0L, 4L, 2L])\n    [0L, 1L]\n    Explanation: 0 is the smallest value,\
  \ but  there are two zeros,\n                 so we will choose the first zero,\
  \ which has the smallest index.\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= nodes.length\
  \ <= 10000\n        * 0 <= node.value\n    \n*/\nlong[] pluck(long[] arr) \n"
