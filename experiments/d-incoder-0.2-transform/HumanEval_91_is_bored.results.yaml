    \ I love this weather. The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather.\"\
    \ It would count the amount of boredoms twice instead of just once. Thanks again!\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou would need to use a loop to go through each character in\
    \ the string. In the loop you would need to check if the character is a boredom\

    \ a dscore=1 |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer! I really appreciate it! I did\
    \ try the code you provided and it worked perfectly! I did have to change a few\
    \ things to make it work. First, I had to change `foreach(char c in S)` to `foreach(char\
    \ c in S.toCharArray())`. Second, I had to change `boredoms += 1;` to `boredoms++;`.\
    \ Third, I had to change `long boredoms = 0;` to `long boredoms = 0;L`. Fourth,\
    \ I had to change `return boredoms;` to `return boredoms;L`. Lastly, I had to\
    \ change `return boredoms;` to `return boredoms;L`. After doing all that, I was\
    \ able to run the program and get the correct output. Thank you so much for your\
    \ help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou're welcome! I edited my answer to include your\
