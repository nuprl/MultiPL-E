    \ |>\nThe first thing that comes to mind is to use a stack to keep track of the\
    \ elements that are not palindromic. Then, for each element in the list, you check\
    \ if it is palindromic and if it is not, you add it to the stack. Then, you check\
    \ if you have a palindromic list by checking if the stack is empty. If it is,\
    \ then you have a palindromic list. Otherwise, you can pop the top element from\
    \ the stack and add it to the palindromic list. \nThis would give you O(n) time\
    \ complexity. \n<code>", "{\n    long sum = 0;\n    for(int i = 0; i < q.Length;\
