    \ solution, but I believe it can be simplified a bit. `diff` can be initialized\
    \ to `0` right in the beginning of the `for` loop and then `diff` can be set to\
    \ `game[i] - guess[i]` inside the `if` statement. Also, `result` can be initialized\
    \ to `guess` instead of `new long[guess.lenth]`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, that\
