    \ I understand that it is counting the number of ways to fill the grid but how\
    \ does it work?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe idea is to count the number of ways to\
    \ fill the grid without exceeding the capacity of the buckets. So we start by\
    \ filling each bucket with one unit of water. Then we move on to the next bucket\
    \ and fill it with the remaining units of water. Continue until we reach the end\
    \ of the grid. At each step, we count the number of ways to fill the grid without\
    \ exceeding the capacity of the buckets. So the total number of ways to fill the\
    \ grid is equal to the number of ways to fill the grid minus the number of ways\
    \ to fill the grid with the remaining units of water. Hope that helps.\n<|/ c\

    \ problem in O(n) time complexity by using a hash table to store the number of\
    \ empty buckets needed for each well. \nThe idea is to iterate over each row and\
    \ each column and for each cell you check if it is empty or not. If it is empty\
    \ you add 1 to the number of empty buckets needed for the cell. If it is not empty\
    \ you subtract 1 from the number of empty buckets needed for the cell. \nThe complexity\
    \ is O(n^2) because for each cell you iterate over all rows and columns. \n<code>\n\

    Thanks for your answer. Can you please explain why you used the variable `count`?\

    The problem is that the number of buckets grows exponentially with the number\
    \ of wells. So the time complexity is O(2^n) which is too slow for large inputs.\n\
    The solution is to keep a running count of how many buckets are filled for each\
    \ well. Then, for each well, we can just subtract the number of buckets filled\
    \ from the number of buckets left in the grid. \n<code>\nlong max_fill(long[][]\
    \ grid, long capacity) {\n    long ans = 0;\n    long n = grid.length;\n    long\
    \ m = grid[0].length;\n    long bucketsFilled = 0;\n    long bucketsLeft = capacity;\n\
    \    \n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\n        for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){\n\
    \            long bucket = grid[i][j];\n            \n            while(bucket\
    \ != 0){\n                bucketsFilled++;\n                bucket -= 1;\n   \
    \         }\n        }\n        ans += bucketsFilled - bucketsLeft;\n        bucketsLeft\
    \ = capacity;\n        bucketsFilled = 0;\n    }\n    \n    return ans;\n}\n</code>\n\

    \ updated my answer, I hope it helps you.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nThe problem\
    \ is that the algorithm is too slow for large grids. I suggest you to use dynamic\
    \ programming to solve this problem. \nThe idea is to keep a table of size 10^5\
    \ x 10^5 and to fill the table with 0's and 1's. \nThe table is filled with 0's\
    \ and 1's in the following way:\n<code>\nfor i from 0 to 10^5\n    for j from\
    \ 0 to 10^5\n        if grid[i][j] == 1\n            table[i][j] = 0\n       \
    \ else\n            table[i][j] = 1\n</code>\nNow to fill the table with 0's and\
    \ 1's, you only need to find the maximum value from the table and subtract it\
    \ from the capacity of the bucket. \n<code>\nfor i from 0 to 10^5\n    for j from\
    \ 0 to 10^5\n        if table[i][j] == 1\n            table[i][j] = 0\n      \
