    \ your answer! I really appreciate it! I did try the code you provided and it\
    \ worked perfectly! I did have to change a few things to make it work. First,\
    \ I had to change `foreach(char c in S)` to `foreach(char c in S.toCharArray())`.\
    \ Second, I had to change `boredoms += 1;` to `boredoms++;`. Third, I had to change\
    \ `long boredoms = 0;` to `long boredoms = 0;L`. Fourth, I had to change `return\
    \ boredoms;` to `return boredoms;L`. Lastly, I had to change `return boredoms;`\
    \ to `return boredoms;L`. After doing all that, I was able to run the program\
    \ and get the correct output. Thank you so much for your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
