    \ |>\nThis answer doesn't use recursion. Recursion is used only in the definition\
    \ of the Fibonacci sequence. In the actual implementation, `fib4` is an array\
    \ of `long` values, and is initialized with the values `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`.\
    \ Then the function `fib4` is called recursively, and each time the function `fib4`\
    \ is called recursively, the array `fib4` is updated to contain the next `long`\
    \ value in the sequence. `fib4` is then returned to the caller, which then assigns\
    \ the returned value to the variable `n`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with you,\
