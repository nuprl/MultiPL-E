    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer. Your solution is very similar to my solution.\
    \ My solution was to find the prime numbers and then to find the words in the\
    \ sentence that have that number of letters. Your solution finds the words in\
    \ the sentence that have that number of letters. I thought that my solution was\
    \ more efficient than yours. But I guess yours is more efficient than mine because\
    \ you only have to find the prime numbers and then you only have to find the words\
    \ in the sentence that have that number of letters. Thanks again for your answer.\n\
