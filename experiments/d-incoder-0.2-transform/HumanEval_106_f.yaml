    \ each element is the factorial of its index. For example, `f(5)` returns `[1L,\
    \ 2L, 6L, 24L, 15L]`. `f` uses recursion to solve the problem. `f` calls itself\
    \ to solve the problem for smaller values of `n`. When `n` is small, `f` returns\
    \ the result immediately. When `n` is large, `f` calls itself to solve the problem\
    \ for smaller values of `n`. The recursive call `f` returns is what gets returned\
    \ to the caller.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand that you are using recursion\
