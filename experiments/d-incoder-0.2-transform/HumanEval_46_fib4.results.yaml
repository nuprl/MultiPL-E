    \ tags=fibonacci,c++,algorithm,c |>\n<| c |>\nI believe this answer should be\
    \ the accepted one. Although it uses recursion, it doesn't use recursion and is\
    \ much simpler to understand.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis answer doesn't use recursion.\
    \ Recursion is used only in the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. In the actual\
    \ implementation, `fib4` is an array of `long` values, and is initialized with\
    \ the values `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`. Then the function `fib4` is called recursively,\
    \ and each time the function `fib4` is called recursively, the array `fib4` is\
    \ updated to contain the next `long` value in the sequence. `fib4` is then returned\
    \ to the caller, which then assigns the returned value to the variable `n`.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with you, that recursion is used only in the definition\
    \ of the Fibonacci sequence. But the actual implementation uses recursion to compute\
    \ the next `long` value in the sequence. `fib4` is then returned to the caller,\
    \ which then assigns the returned value to the variable `n`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
