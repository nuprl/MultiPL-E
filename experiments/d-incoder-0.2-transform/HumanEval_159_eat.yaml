    \ you misunderstood my question. I am not trying to find the number of carrots\

    \ meals AND the number of carrots eaten after my meals. So for example, if you\
    \ have eaten 5 carrots and have 10 carrots left to eat, then the answer is [5,\
    \ 10], because you eat 5 carrots and have 10 carrots left.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\

    , and it's an NP-hard problem. There are some interesting approaches to solve\
    \ this problem (see the Wikipedia article), but they all have some drawbacks.\n\
    The most obvious drawback is that they require exponential time complexity. For\
    \ example, if you have 10 carrots and need to eat 5 carrots, you will have to\
    \ do 10 multiplications and 10 additions, which is O(10^5). \nThe second drawback\
    \ is that they require exponential memory usage. For example, if you have 10 carrots\
    \ and need to eat 5 carrots, you will have to store 10 carrots in memory, which\
    \ is O(10^5). \nThe third drawback is that they require exponential time complexity\
    \ and exponential memory usage. For example, if you have ", "{\n    long carrots\

    \ variables. I thought that long was the most efficient data type. Do you know\
    \ why you think so?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used long to avoid overflow. Since carrots\
    \ is an int, it can only hold a max value of 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647). Since carrotsLeft\
    \ is an int, it can only hold a max value of 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647). Since carrotsEaten\
    \ and carrotsLeftEaten are both int, they can only hold a max value of 2^31-1\
    \ (2,147,483,647). Since carrots and carrotsLeft are both longs, they can hold\
    \ a max value of 2^63-1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807). Since carrotsEaten and carrotsLeftEaten\
    \ are both longs, they can hold a max value of 2^63-1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807).\n\

    Thanks for your answer. Your solution works perfectly for me. I am still trying\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nRecursion is basically a way of breaking down problems into\

    \ you to eat more carrots. So the base case is when you have eaten all the carrots.\
    \ When you eat all the carrots, you get your answer. Otherwise, you eat some more\
