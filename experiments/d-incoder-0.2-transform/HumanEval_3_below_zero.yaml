    \ `0` each time through the loop. If `balance` is less than `0` then `i` is incremented\
    \ by 1 and the loop continues. If `balance` is greater than `0` then `i` is incremented\

    \ you please explain why my code doesn't work?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe reason\
    \ your code doesn't work is that you are always returning from the function on\
    \ the first iteration of the loop. In the first iteration, `balance < 0` is false,\
    \ so the function returns immediately. In the second iteration, `balance < 0`\
    \ is true, so the function returns immediately. In the third iteration, `balance\
    \ < 0` is false, so the function returns immediately. In the fourth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns immediately. In the fifth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is false, so the function returns immediately. In the sixth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns immediately. In the seventh iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is false, so the function returns immediately. In the eighth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns immediately. In the ninth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is false, so the function returns immediately. In the tenth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns immediately. In the eleventh\
    \ iteration, `balance < 0` is false, so the function returns immediately. In the\
    \ twelfth iteration, `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns immediately.\
    \ In the thirteenth iteration, `balance < 0` is false, so the function returns\
    \ immediately. In the fourteenth iteration, `balance < 0` is true, so the function\
    \ returns immediately. In the fifteenth iteration, `balance < 0` is false, so\
    \ the function returns immediately. In the sixteenth iteration, `balance < 0`\
    \ is true, so the function returns immediately. In the seventeenth iteration,\
    \ `balance < 0` is false, so the function returns immediately. ", "{\n    long\

    \ work, but I cannot use any loops, only recursion.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI understand\
    \ that but you said you were not allowed to use loops. Recursion is just one way\
    \ to solve this problem. Another way would be to keep track of the balance and\
    \ compare it to the starting balance to see if it goes below zero.\n<|/ c |>\n\
