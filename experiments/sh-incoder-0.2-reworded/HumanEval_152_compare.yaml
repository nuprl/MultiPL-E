  # You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index\
  \ shows a match. \n# Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each\
  \ guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the\
  \ value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\n\
  # >>> $(compare \"1 2 3 4 5 1\" \"1 2 3 4 2 -2\")\n# ['\"0\"', '\"0\"', '\"0\"',\
  \ '\"0\"', '\"3\"', '\"3\"']\n# >>> $(compare \"0 5 0 0 0 4\" \"4 1 1 0 0 -2\")\n\
