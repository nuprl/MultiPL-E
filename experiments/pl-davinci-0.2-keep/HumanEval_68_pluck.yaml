prompt: "# \"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative\
  \ integer nodes\n# your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n# The\
  \ plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n# If multiple nodes\
  \ with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest\
  \ index.\n# The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its\
  \ index ],\n# If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\
  # Example 1:\n# Input: [4,2,3]\n# Output: [2, 1]\n# Explanation: 2 has the smallest\
  \ even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n# Example 2:\n# Input: [1,2,3]\n# Output:\
  \ [2, 1]\n# Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\
  \ \n# Example 3:\n# Input: []\n# Output: []\n# Example 4:\n# Input: [5, 0, 3, 0,\
  \ 4, 2]\n# Output: [0, 1]\n# Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are\
  \ two zeros,\n# so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n\
  # Constraints:\n# * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n# * 0 <= node.value\nsub pluck {\n\
