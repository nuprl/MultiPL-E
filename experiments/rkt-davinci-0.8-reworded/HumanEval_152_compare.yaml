  \ at that moment are\n;; definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n;; Your task\
  \ is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n\
  ;; You are given two lists of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index\
  \ shows a match. \n;; Return a list of the same length denoting how far off each\
  \ guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n;; the value is 0, and if not, the\
  \ value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n;; example:\n\

    \ Racket. My question is, is there a better way to do what I did in the <code>compare</code>\
    \ function, using something like <code>define</code> or <code>lambda</code>? \n\
    \n\nA:\n\nOne thing you can improve is to write the function body on one line,\
    \ with the help of <code>let</code>. That way you only have to use one <code>lambda</code>\
    \ expression and it becomes more readable:\n<code>(define (compare game guess)\n\
    \  (map (let ([x 'x] [y 'y])\n         (cond [(= x y) 0]\n               [else\
    \ (abs (- x y))]))\n       game guess))\n</code>\nI also changed the local variables\
    \ <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to <code>'x</code> and <code>'y</code>, that\
    \ way it won't collide with the variables of the same name in the function body.\n\
    Finally, I would also suggest to name the function <code>compare-scores</code>\
    \ so that you can have a function named <code>compare</code> at the top level\
    \ of your program, that is the <code>compare</code> procedure from the <code>racket/base</code>\

    \ know if my code has any problems or not.\n\n\nA:\n\nThere are quite a few things\
    \ about your code that could use work.\n\nYour indentation is inconsistent. If\
    \ you had more lines of code, it would be even more unclear where things start\
    \ and end.\nYour line-length is off. The maximum line length is 80 characters,\
    \ and in many places you're exceeding that.\nYour solution to the first problem\
    \ is not very efficient, since you're traversing the list multiple times. Furthermore,\
    \ it's not very functional, since it depends on a mutable external variable.\n\
    The names you've chosen are not very good. A better name for <code>list-of-numbers</code>\
    \ is <code>number-list</code>.\nYour solution for the second problem is not very\
    \ modular: you're performing the same computation twice.\nIn your second solution,\
    \ you're using <code>let</code> without <code>#lang racket</code> at the top of\
    \ the file.\nYour <code>compare</code> function is not very idiomatic: you could've\
    \ simplified it to <code>(map abs (map - game guess))</code> (and even better,\

    </code>\nWhat I'm thinking here is that <code>if</code> statement will return\
    \ true if the first element of game and guess are equal. If they are, I return\
    \ <code>0</code>, if not, the absolute difference. \nAll of this is wrapped in\
    \ a <code>cons</code> so the result is put in a list. The recursion is on <code>rest</code>\
    \ so I end up with a list of the same length.\n\n\nA:\n\nThat's almost correct,\
    \ with a few minor details that must be changed.\nFor example, you're using the\
    \ <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code> functions, but <code>game</code> and\
    \ <code>guess</code> can also be a number, a boolean or other types, so you have\
    \ to make sure that the arguments are lists before you extract their first and\
    \ rest elements. This can be done with the <code>list?</code> predicate:\n<code>(define\
    \ (compare game guess)\n  (if (list? game)\n      (if (list? guess)\n        \
    \  (cons (if (= (first game) (first guess)) 0 (abs (- (first game) (first guess))))\n\
    \                (compare (rest game) (rest guess)))\n          empty)\n     \
    \ empty))\n</code>\nAlso, there's no need to do this <code>(abs (- (first game)\
    \ (first guess)))</code> because <code>-</code> works just fine with positive\
    \ and negative numbers, and in fact if <code>game</code> and <code>guess</code>\
    \ are lists of numbers, the expression <code>(first game) - (first guess)</code>\
    \ will evaluate to a negative number if the guess is higher than the score, and\
    \ a positive number if it's smaller than the score. So we can rewrite it this\
    \ way:\n<code>(define (compare game guess)\n  (if (list? game)\n      (if (list?\
