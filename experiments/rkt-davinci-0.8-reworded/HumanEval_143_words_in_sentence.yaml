    </code>\nI know it's a very verbose code, but I don't know how to make it shorter\
    \ or to make the code more functional. I did add all of the constraints to the\
    \ code, so that the code would work. I did the input validation in the beginning\
    \ of each function, because I don't know how to do it properly in Racket. I am\
    \ really new to the functional world and I have some problems with the order of\
    \ the function, because I have problems understanding how the order of the functions\
    \ affects the flow of the code.\nI read somewhere that the order of the function\
    \ in the code doesn't matter, but when I tried to move the functions around, I\
    \ broke the code. Also, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to put the code in the same\
    \ order I did, because I feel like I'm abusing the syntax and I'm pretty sure\
    \ I'm not doing it the right way.\n\n\nA:\n\nI don't know much about racket but\
