    </code>\nWhich is a bit more complicated than I think it should be.\nOf course,\
    \ my question is: how to implement <code>balanced?</code>?\n\n\nA:\n\nTo check\
    \ if something is a palindrome, you have to compare each element with the corresponding\
    \ element on the other side of the list (if there are an odd number of elements,\
    \ the center element is not compared). \nYou can do that using a helper function\
    \ that takes two list arguments and compares their first elements and then calls\
    \ itself on the rest of the lists. When one of the lists is empty you know it's\
    \ a palindrome.\nHere's an implementation:\n<code>(define (balanced? lst)\n  (define\
    \ (balanced? lst1 lst2)\n    (cond\n      [(empty? lst1) #t]\n      [(empty? lst2)\
    \ #t]\n      [(equal? (first lst1) (first lst2)) (balanced? (rest lst1) (rest\
    \ lst2))]\n      [else #f]))\n  (balanced? lst (reverse lst)))\n</code>\nIt uses\
    \ the built-in <code>reverse</code> function and the helper function <code>balanced?</code>\
    \ to compare the list with the reversed list. When one of the lists is empty it\
    \ has reached the middle of the original list, hence it's a palindrome.\n\n(require\
    \ rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate will_it_fly))\n\
    \    (check-equal? (candidate (list 3 2 3) 9) #t)\n    (check-equal? (candidate\
    \ (list 1 2) 5) #f)\n    (check-equal? (candidate (list 3) 5) #t)\n    (check-equal?\
    \ (candidate (list 3 2 3) 1) #f)\n    (check-equal? (candidate (list 1 2 3) 6)\
    \ #f)\n    (check-equal? (candidate (list 5) 5) #t)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)"

    \ help will be appreciated.\n\n\nA:\n\nYou need to include a definition for <code>sum</code>\
    \ and <code>palindrome?</code> in your definition of <code>will_it_fly</code>.\
    \ \nSomething like this:\n<code>(define (will_it_fly q w)\n  (define (sum lst)\n\
    \    (cond ((null? lst) 0)\n          (else (+ (car lst) (sum (cdr lst))))))\n\
    \  (define (palindrome? lst)\n    (cond ((null? lst) #t)\n          ((null? (cdr\
    \ lst)) #t)\n          ((not (equal? (car lst) (car (reverse lst)))) #f)\n   \
    \       (else (palindrome? (cdr (reverse (cdr lst)))))))\n  (if (eq? (length q)\
    \ 0)\n      #t\n      (cond ((eq? (length q) 1) #t)\n            ((&gt; (sum q)\
    \ w) #f)\n            ((not (palindrome? q)) #f)\n            (else #t))))\n</code>\n\
    I'm assuming that the definitions of <code>sum</code> and <code>palindrome?</code>\
    \ are correct, and you know how to write them. You could also define those functions\
    \ in the global scope (before calling <code>will_it_fly</code>), in which case\
    \ your definition of <code>will_it_fly</code> would be a little simpler:\n<code>(define\
    \ (will_it_fly q w)\n  (if (eq? (length q) 0)\n      #t\n      (cond ((eq? (length\
    \ q) 1) #t)\n            ((&gt; (sum q) w) #f)\n            ((not (pal\n(require\
