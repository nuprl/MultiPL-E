    \n[Download here](http://danielrodriguez.net/static/collatz.zip)\n\nOnce downloaded,\
    \ and unzipped, you should have a folder called `collatz`.\n\nFrom the command\
    \ line, and in this folder, you can do:\n\n```bash\nracket collatz.rkt\n```\n\n\
    Or you can open the file `collatz.rkt` in DrRacket and run it.\n\nThe program\
    \ should ask for a number, and show you the Collatz sequence and the md5 hash\
    \ for this number.\n\n## Problems\n\nThere are four problems included in this\
    \ assignment, from which you only have to solve the first three. The fourth problem\
    \ is optional.\n\n### Problem 1\n\nThe program should ask for a number, and show\
    \ you the Collatz sequence and the md5 hash for this number.\n\nThe program should\
    \ only show the Collatz sequence, the number of iterations, and the md5 hash of\
    \ the sequence.\n\nThe program should only ask for one number, then stop.\n\n\
    ### Problem 2\n\nThe program should ask for a number, and show you the Collatz\
    \ sequence and the md5 hash for this number.\n\nThe program should only show the\
    \ Collatz sequence, the number of iterations, and the md5 hash of the sequence.\n\
    \nThe program should keep asking for numbers until the user types `q`.\n\n###\
    \ Problem 3\n\nThe program should ask for a number, and show you the Collatz sequence\
    \ and the md5 hash for this number.\n\nThe program should only show the Collatz\
    \ sequence, the number of iterations, and the md5 hash of the sequence.\n\nThe\
    \ program should keep asking for numbers until the user types `q`.\n\nIf a number\
    \ is entered that is not an integer, or that is a negative integer, it should\
    \ print an error message, but continue running.\n\n### Problem 4 (optional)\n\n\
    The program should ask for a number, and show you the Collatz sequence and the\
    \ md5 hash for this number.\n\nThe program should only show the Collatz sequence,\
    \ the number of iterations, and the md", "  (match text\n    [\"\" #f]\n    [_\

    \ I can't figure out what the problem is. Any help is appreciated.\n\n\nA:\n\n\
    Your usage of <code>match</code> is wrong. <code>match</code> is designed to deconstruct\
    \ structure. You can compare a value, but it has to be an attribute of a structure.\n\
    I think what you want is to use <code>cond</code>:\n<code>(define (string_to_md5\
    \ text)\n  (cond\n    [(string=? text \"\") #f]\n    [else (md5 (string-&gt;bytes/utf-8\
