    \ we will explore errors in order to understand how to properly handle errors\
    \ and how to properly\nuse the `cond` expression.\n\n##### Working with Errors\n\
    \nIn this section, we will learn the following:\n\n1. the difference between the\
    \ `error` and `raise` functions.\n2. how to use the `cond` expression to make\
    \ a decision based on different error conditions.\n\nIn the below definition,\
    \ the `number-or-error` function takes as an argument a string that represents\
    \ a number.\nThe function returns an integer or raises an error depending on the\
    \ context.\n\nIf the string can be converted to an integer, an integer is returned.\
    \ If the string can not be converted, an\nerror is raised.\n\n```\n#lang racket\n",

    I am fairly new to Racket, so any tips on what a better way to do this would be\

    \ curr (+ 1 curr-count))\n                    max))))))\n</code>\nIn your code,\
    \ you keep filtering out elements from the list that match the current head, but\
    \ you can keep track of the occurrence count of each number in a hash. \nI've\
    \ commented out the first few lines for brevity.\nNote that if you're going to\

    I know this is not the most efficient solution, but I would like to know if there\

    \ Return the\n  greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency\n\
    \  greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. The\n  frequency\
    \ of an integer is the number of times it appears in the\n  list. If no such a\
    \ value exist, return -1. In addition, if there are\n  duplicate integers with\
    \ the same frequency in the list, choose the\n  integer with the largest value.\
    \ Examples:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (search (list\
    \ 4 1 2 2 3 1)) \n2\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (search (list 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4))\
    \ \n3\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (search (list 5 5 4 4 4)) \n-1\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\
    \ (search (list 4 4 2 2 1 1)) \n2\n&lt;/code&gt;</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\
    In the last line of the examples, the result is 2, because 1 and 4 are both repeated\
    \ 2 times and the problem asks to take the greater of the two. So far, I have\
    \ tried to add the following snippet of code to the problem:\n<code>(define (contains-freq\
    \ lst num)\n  (if (null? lst) #f\n      (if (= (count (car lst) lst) num) #t\n\
    \          (contains-freq (cdr lst) num))))\n</code>\nBasically, I want to verify\
    \ if the list contains a number that has the same frequency as the current element\

    \    (define (freq v) (cdr (assoc v freqs)))\n    (define (vals-with-freq n)\n\

    \ (first (greater-than (freq (first lst))))))))))\n</code>\nThen, you can use\
    \ the procedure <code>search</code> as follows:\n<code>(search (list 4 1 2 2 3\
    \ 1))\n=&gt; 2", "  (define (find-max lst)\n    (cond ((null? lst) -1)\n     \

    \ lst))\n  (find-max (filter-frequency lst)))\n</code>\nI've just started with\
    \ Racket, so any other comments are welcome.\n\n\nA:\n\nOn the positive side,\
    \ you have a nice header comment. I like the way you've broken down the problem\
    \ into parts, with a separate <code>find-max</code> and <code>filter-frequency</code>\
    \ function. It's also good that you've wrapped the whole thing in a <code>search</code>\
    \ function.\nThe frequency-filtering function seems to be basically right, though\
    \ it uses inefficient recursive calls to <code>count</code>. A better version\
    \ would be:\n<code>(define (filter-frequency lst)\n  (filter (lambda (n)\n   \
    \         (&gt;= (count n lst) n))\n          lst))\n</code>\nThat is, you can\
    \ call <code>count</code> just once for each element of the list. Your version\
    \ might take linear time, but this version is at worst quadratic in the length\
    \ of the list.\nThe maximum-finding function has a few problems. First of all,\
    \ it's inefficient, because it does a linear number of comparisons, instead of\
    \ the logarithmic number that a proper sort would do.\nSecond, its termination\
    \ condition seems wrong. The top two elements of the list are guaranteed to be\
    \ sorted, so if the top one is greater than the second, then it will be the largest\
    \ element of the list. But suppose that the list is <code>(5 4 3 2 1)</code>.\
    \ Your function will compare <code>5</code> to <code>4</code>, find that <code>5</code>\
    \ is greater, and then return <code>5</", "  (cond\n    [(empty? lst) -1]\n  \

    \ solution is in O(n) and the <code>map</code> is not needed:\n<code>(define (search\
