    \ repl:\n<code>&gt; (sum_product (list 1 2 3 4))\n&gt; (list 10 24)\n</code>\n\
    I think the output is correct, however I would have expected the result to be\
    \ displayed as (10 24) rather than (list 10 24). I understand that the parentheses\
    \ are used to indicate the beginning and the end of a list in racket. How do I\
    \ get rid of the word \"list\" in the output and display it as just (10 24)?\n\
    I am very new to racket and would appreciate any help.\nThanks in advance.\n\n\
    \nA:\n\nThe <code>list</code> there is just racket's way of letting you know that\
    \ you have a list. If you do a <code>(define list-thing (list 1 2 3 4))</code>\
    \ and then do <code>list-thing</code> you'll get\n<code>'(1 2 3 4)\n</code>\n\
    You can also test this by doing <code>(car list-thing)</code> to get <code>1</code>.\n\
    Racket lets you know when you're in a list because you can be in any arbitrary\
    \ number of nested lists and it would be difficult to tell if you were in a list\
    \ or just in a set of parens containing an expression.\nIf you want to see what\
    \ your function returns, you can do something like\n<code>(define (sum_product\
    \ numbers)\n  (let ([sum (apply + numbers)]\n        [product (apply * numbers)])\n\
    \    (displayln sum)\n    (displayln product)\n    (list sum product)))\n</code>\n",

    How do I go about this? What is the \"in-built\" way to get the sum of a list\
    \ and the product of a list?\n\n\nA:\n\nThere's no \"built-in\" way to do this.\
    \ However, these are not hard to implement with recursive loops. Remember that\
    \ the base case is when the list is empty, and then you just return the appropriate\
    \ value for that case. In all other cases, you can recursively call the function\
    \ and combine the recursive call's result with the current element. For example:\n\

    \ is define a single function <code>sum-and-product</code> that takes the list\

    \ function, one called <code>sum</code> and the other called <code>product</code>.\
    \ The function <code>sum</code> should calculate the sum of the list of numbers\
    \ (similar to <code>sum-product</code> above), and the function <code>product</code>\
    \ should calculate the product (also similar to <code>sum-product</code> above).\
    \ So basically I am trying to rename the functions inside <code>sum-and-product</code>.\n\
    Note that I do not want to create a function that returns a list of the sum and\
    \ product. \nFor example, if I have a list of integers <code>(list 1 2 3 4)</code>,\
    \ then I would like to be able to call\n<code>(sum (list 1 2 3 4))\n</code>\n\
    and it should return 10, and\n<code>(product (list 1 2 3 4))\n</code>\nand it\
    \ should return 24.\nI know how to define these functions separately, as in\n\
    <code>(define (sum numbers)\n  (for/fold ([total 0]) ([n (in-list numbers)])\n\
    \    (+ total n)))\n", "  (define (sum n)\n    (if (null? n)\n        0\n    \
