    \ to implement the recursive function within the car_race_collision function.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nYour <code>solve</code> function is defined using <code>define</code>\
    \ while it should be defined with <code>define/recursive</code>. \n<code>(define/recursive\
    \ (solve n)\n  (cond [(zero? n) 0]\n        [else (+ 1 (solve (- n 1)))]))\n</code>\n\

    Could anyone give me some hints as to how to prove this or if there is a better\
    \ way to prove this?\n\n\nA:\n\nThis could be a possible way to explain the complexity\
    \ of your algorithm:\n<code>(define (car_race_collision n)\n  (cond [(= n 0) 0]\n\
    \        [(= n 1) 0]\n        [else (+ (car_race_collision (- n 1)) n)]))\n</code>\n\
    The first two clauses of the <code>cond</code> could be translated to <code>O(1)</code>\
    \ in terms of time complexity. It is not difficult to see that the cost of each\
    \ recursive call is <code>O(n)</code>. So we can claim that the time complexity\
    \ of this algorithm is the following:\n<code>T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n) = T(n-2) + O(n-1)\
    \ + O(n)\n     = T(n-3) + O(n-2) + O(n-1) + O(n)\n     = ...\n     = T(1) + O(2)\
    \ + O(3) + ... + O(n)\n     = O(1) + O(n) + O(n-1) + ... + O(1)\n     = O(1) +\
    \ O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... + O(1) + O(n)\n     = O(1) + O(n) + O(n)\n     = O(n^2)\n\
    </code>\nThe same technique could be applied to many algorithms, especially the\
    \ ones that use recursion.\n\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\

    Is it because <code>helper</code> is defined in the local context of <code>car_race_collision</code>?\
    \  if so, how do I access <code>helper</code> from <code>helper</code>?\n\n\n\
    A:\n\nJust rename the helper function:\n<code>(define (car_race_collision n)\n\
    \  (define (helper-2 i lst1 lst2)\n    (if (&lt; i n)\n        (helper-2 (+ i\
    \ 1) (cons (+ i (* n 1)) lst1) (cons (- (* n n) i) lst2))\n        'done))\n \
    \ (helper-2 0 null null))\n</code>\nAnd it works.\nBut I don't understand why\
    \ you are defining a function inside another. Just define the function outside,\
    \ and if you want to create private procedures, use <code>let</code>:\n<code>(define\
    \ (car_race_collision n)\n  (let helper-2 ([i 0] [lst1 null] [lst2 null])\n  \
    \  (if (&lt; i n)\n        (helper-2 (+ i 1) (cons (+ i (* n 1)) lst1) (cons (-\
    \ (* n n) i) lst2))\n        'done)))\n</code>\nNow it works.\n\n(require rackunit)\n\

    \ way is right because I can't figure out what if the n is large number.\nIf the\
    \ n is large number, Should I use accumulate or range?\nI cannot replace the accumulate\
    \ with the range.\nSo, I'm not sure.\nHow can I find out the number of collisions?\n\
    How can I think about the infinite large number?\n\n\nA:\n\nTo find the number\
    \ of collisions you need to find the number of car pairs that collide, and given\
    \ that all cars have the same speed, the only way two cars collide is when they\
    \ have the same position at the same time (and therefore they need to start at\
    \ the same position).\nIn a car race there are two sets of cars, one travelling\
    \ left to right and the other right to left, so the right to left cars need to\
    \ start at the same position of the left to right cars to collide with them, but\
    \ they start on the opposite side of the road and they need to cross it to meet.\n\
    So you're looking for the number of car pairs that start at the same position\
    \ on the road.\nIn other words, you need to count the number of pairs of indices\
    \ <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> such that <code>i != j</code> and <code>i\
    \ + j == n</code>.\nThis can be implemented like this:\n<code>(define (car-race-collisions\
    \ n)\n  (accumulate + 0 (for/list ([i (in-range 1 n)]\n                      \
    \      [j (in-range i n)])\n                    (if (= i j) 1 0))))\n</code>\n\
    So how do you think about it?\nYou need to figure out what is the relationship\
    \ between the car pairs that collide, so you can count them. Once you know that,\
    \ then you just need to implement it.\n\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval)\

    \ second case is $n=3$.  There are four collisions, so this case will be a little\

    </code>\nI think that the recursive part should be something like this\n<code>(define\
    \ (car_race_collision n)\n   (if (zero? n)\n      0\n      (+ 1 (car_race_collision\
    \ (- n 1)))))\n</code>\nbut I am not sure what the base case should be. I would\
    \ like to know if this is the right direction.\n\n\nA:\n\nThis is basically the\
    \ same as the <code>collision</code> function in this answer.  You can use <code>map</code>\
    \ to iterate over each car, use the <code>-</code> operator to subtract one from\
    \ the index of the left-driving cars and <code>+</code> to add one to the index\
    \ of the right-driving cars.  Then you <code>filter</code> for collisions and\
    \ use <code>length</code> to get the number of collisions.\n<code>(define (car-race-collision\
    \ n)\n  (length\n   (filter (curry = 0)\n           (map * (range 0 n)\n     \
    \            (map + (range 0 n)\n                       (map - (range n 0 -1)))))))\n\

    \ <code>0</code> when I execute <code>(car_race_collision 3)</code> and <code>1</code>\

    \ nested <code>for</code> loops and check if <code>(- car-from-left car-from-right)</code>\
    \ is equal to <code>0</code>.\nWhat is the problem with my function and how can\
    \ I fix it?\n\n\nA:\n\nYou're right to use two nested <code>for</code> loops.\
    \ However, <code>for</code> loops in Racket work differently from <code>for</code>\
    \ loops in other languages. They are really just an abstraction around <code>for/fold</code>,\
    \ which takes in a function, an initial value, and a range to iterate over. So\
    \ your code should be something like this:\n<code>(define (car_race_collision\
    \ n)\n  (for/fold ([num-collisions 0]) ([car-from-left (- n 1)])\n    (for/fold\
    \ ([num-collisions num-collisions]) ([car-from-right (- n 1)])\n      (if (= (-\
    \ car-from-left car-from-right) 0)\n          (+ num-collisions 1)\n         \
    \ num-collisions))))\n</code>\nFor a different solution, you could use a <code>for/sum</code>,\
    \ which already returns the sum of a range. So your code would look something\
    \ like this:\n<code>(define (car_race_collision n)\n  (for/sum ([car-from-left\
    \ (- n 1)])\n    (for/sum ([car-from-right (- n 1)])\n      (if (= (- car-\n(require\
    \ rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate car_race_collision))\n\

    \ to start. How do I use the racket to solve this problem? Thanks for the help!\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nExercise: Before you read this answer, try to solve this problem on\
    \ your own. I'm sure you will learn more by attempting it yourself.\n\nAs the\
    \ comments suggested, this problem can be solved efficiently using binary search.\
    \ One way to think about this problem is to imagine the road as a number line.\
    \ The moving cars are going to be points moving on this number line.\nImagine\
    \ we have n cars going left to right. We can think of these cars as points moving\
    \ from x to y. We do the same for the cars going right to left (y to x). We can\
    \ sort the cars going left to right in increasing order (A1, A2, ..., An). And\
    \ the cars going right to left in decreasing order (B1, B2, ..., Bn).\nThis problem\
    \ can be solved by finding the number of cars that would collide if we merge the\
    \ two sorted lists and then iterating over the merged list to count the number\
    \ of collisions.\nThe naive solution would look something like this:\n<code>(define\
    \ (merge-count l1 l2)\n  (let loop ([l1 l1] [l2 l2] [count 0])\n    (cond\n  \
    \    [(empty? l1) (+ count (length l2))]\n      [(empty? l2) (+ count (length\
    \ l1))]\n      [(&lt; (car l1) (car l2)) (loop (cdr l1) l2 (+ count (length l2)))]\n\
    \      [else (loop l1 (cdr l2) (+ count (length l1)))])))\n</code>\nThe more elegant\
    \ solution would use binary search:\n<code>(define (merge-count l1 l2)\n  (let\
    \ loop ([l1 l1] [l2 l2] [count 0])\n    (cond\n      [(empty? l1) (+ count (length\
    \ l2))]\n      [(empty? l2) (+ count (length l1))]\n      [(&lt; (car l1) (car\
    \ l2)) (loop (cdr l1) l2 (+ count (length l2)))]\n\n(require rackunit)\n\n(define\

    \ (candidate 2) 4)\n    (check-equal? (candidate 3) 9)\n    (check-equal? (candidate\
    \ 4) 16)\n    (check-equal? (candidate 8) 64)\n    (check-equal? (candidate 10)\
