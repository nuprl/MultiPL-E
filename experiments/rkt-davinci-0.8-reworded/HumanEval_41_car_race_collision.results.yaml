    \ to implement the recursive function within the car_race_collision function.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nYour <code>solve</code> function is defined using <code>define</code>\
    \ while it should be defined with <code>define/recursive</code>. \n<code>(define/recursive\
    \ (solve n)\n  (cond [(zero? n) 0]\n        [else (+ 1 (solve (- n 1)))]))\n</code>\n\
