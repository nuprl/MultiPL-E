    <code>sortThird :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]\nsortThird [] = []\nsortThird (x:xs) = do\n\

    \ How do I make it only modify values in multiples of three? I know that Haskell\
    \ is a lot more concise than Racket, but I can't find much for \"Racket to Haskell\"\
    \ resources. Thanks!\n\n\nA:\n\nA very simple way of writing it:\n<code>sortThird\
    \ :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]\nsortThird = zipWith (&amp;) &lt;*&gt; map sort . triples\n\
    \  where\n    triples (a:b:c:rest) = [a,b,c] : triples rest\n    triples _ = []\n\
    </code>\n<code>zipWith (&amp;)</code> zips two lists together while applying a\
    \ function to each pair of elements. <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is the applicative\
    \ version of <code>map</code>. So <code>zipWith (&amp;) &lt;*&gt; f</code> takes\
    \ a list of functions and a list of things and applies a function from the first\
    \ list to a thing from the second list.\nThe <code>triples</code> function simply\
    \ takes every three elements from a list and puts them into a list.\nSo this works\
    \ as follows:\n<code>sortThird [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\nzipWith (&amp;) &lt;*&gt;\
    \ map sort . triples $ [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\nzipWith (&amp;) [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt;\
    \ map sort (triples [4,5,", "  (cond [(null? l) null]\n        [(= 0 (modulo (length\

    I'm not sure what the issue is.  I've played around with it but with no luck.\
    \  Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nA:\n\nYou haven't shown us where\
    \ the error is happening.  From the error message it appears to be in the <code>append</code>\
    \ call at the end of the function, so that is where I have focused my answer.\n\
    The error is caused by the fact that <code>append</code> requires two arguments,\
    \ but you are passing it just one argument.  What you want is <code>(append (sort_third\
    \ (take (length l) 3)) ...)</code>.  (I can't tell what <code>...</code> should\
    \ be, since your code is a bit confusing.)\nIf you run your program through <code>racket\
    \ -t &lt;file.rkt&gt;</code> it will print a trace of the program's execution\
    \ which will show you which function call is failing, and where it is failing.\
    \  For instance, using your code:\n<code>$ racket -t sort.rkt\nsort.rkt:11: append:\
    \ contract violation\n  expected: (listof? any)\n  given: '()\n  in: (append '()\
    \ ...)\n  context...:\n   /home/tom/racket/racket/collects/racket/private/misc.rkt:87:7\n\
