    \ get this formatted properly?\n\n\nA:\n\nThe problem here is that <code>#lang</code>\
    \ lines are not Racket code. In other words, the <code>#lang</code> lines are\
    \ processed before the rest of the code, which might affect the language that\
    \ is used to interpret the rest of the code.\nIn your case, the <code>#lang</code>\
    \ line is interpreted as a comment, and therefore it doesn't change the language\
    \ in which the rest of the code is interpreted.\nIn your case, the <code>#lang</code>\
    \ line doesn't do anything, since it's not valid Racket code.\n", "  (* (/ a 2)\
