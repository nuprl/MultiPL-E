    \n##### Challenges\n* [X] Implement and test `(car_race_collision n)` in 10 minutes.\n\
    \n### Linear Regression\n\n##### Background\n\nWe have a set of data points (x,\
    \ y).  Our goal is to find a line that best fits the data.\n\nWe seek the line\
    \ y = ax + b.\n\nWe assume the error between the values of y that are predicted\
    \ by our line and those that come from the data is distributed normally around\
    \ 0, and we seek to minimize the error.\n\nThe values of a and b are the best\
    \ fit line parameters.\n\n##### Code\n\n```racket\n#lang racket\n", "  (if (or\
    \ (null? n) (null? (cdr n)))\n      0\n      (+ (length (intersection n (reverse\
    \ n))) (car_race_collision (cdr n)))))", "  (local\n    [;; ;; Complete the implementation\

    \     [else (+ 1 (solve (- n 1)))]))]\n    (solve n)))\n</code>\nOkay, first part\
    \ (before the local) is easy. It's the second part that stumps me. \n<code>(define\
    \ (solve n)\n  (cond [(zero? n) 0]\n        [else (+ 1 (solve (- n 1)))]))\n</code>\n\
    So this is a recursive function that does a countdown, starting at n and ending\
    \ at 0. It works in Racket. So the question is, how do I integrate this into the\
    \ first part of the code. I tried moving the solve function within the car_race_collision\
    \ function (not within local). But I get the error message:\n<code>car_race_collision:\
    \ undefined;\n cannot reference an identifier before its definition\n</code>\n\
    I'm not sure how to define the solve function within the function car_race_collision.\
    \ I know what the code is supposed to do: it is supposed to output the number\
    \ of collisions in a race between two cars going opposite directions. I just don't\
    \ know how to implement the recursive function within the car_race_collision function.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nYour <code>solve</code> function is defined using <code>define</code>\
    \ while it should be defined with <code>define/recursive</code>. \n<code>(define/recursive\
    \ (solve n)\n  (cond [(zero? n) 0]\n        [else (+ 1 (solve (- n 1)))]))\n</code>\n\
