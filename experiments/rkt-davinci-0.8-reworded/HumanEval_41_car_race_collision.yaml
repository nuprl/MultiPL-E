    \n### Linear Regression\n\n##### Background\n\nWe have a set of data points (x,\
    \ y).  Our goal is to find a line that best fits the data.\n\nWe seek the line\
    \ y = ax + b.\n\nWe assume the error between the values of y that are predicted\
    \ by our line and those that come from the data is distributed normally around\
    \ 0, and we seek to minimize the error.\n\nThe values of a and b are the best\
    \ fit line parameters.\n\n##### Code\n\n```racket\n#lang racket\n", "  (if (or\
    \ (null? n) (null? (cdr n)))\n      0\n      (+ (length (intersection n (reverse\

    \ (before the local) is easy. It's the second part that stumps me. \n<code>(define\

    So this is a recursive function that does a countdown, starting at n and ending\
    \ at 0. It works in Racket. So the question is, how do I integrate this into the\
    \ first part of the code. I tried moving the solve function within the car_race_collision\
    \ function (not within local). But I get the error message:\n<code>car_race_collision:\
    \ undefined;\n cannot reference an identifier before its definition\n</code>\n\
    I'm not sure how to define the solve function within the function car_race_collision.\
    \ I know what the code is supposed to do: it is supposed to output the number\
    \ of collisions in a race between two cars going opposite directions. I just don't\
    \ know how to implement the recursive function within the car_race_collision function.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nYour <code>solve</code> function is defined using <code>define</code>\
    \ while it should be defined with <code>define/recursive</code>. \n<code>(define/recursive\
    \ (solve n)\n  (cond [(zero? n) 0]\n        [else (+ 1 (solve (- n 1)))]))\n</code>\n\

    \ of this algorithm is the following:\n<code>T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n) = T(n-2) + O(n-1)\
    \ + O(n)\n     = T(n-3) + O(n-2) + O(n-1) + O(n)\n     = ...\n     = T(1) + O(2)\

    \ O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... + O(1) + O(n)\n     = O(1) + O(n) + O(n)\n     = O(n^2)\n\

    \ start at the same position of the left to right cars to collide with them, but\

    So you're looking for the number of car pairs that start at the same position\

    \ function that sums the number of collisions for the remaining cars.  In case\
    \ the two cars are equal, we have a collision and we keep going.  In case the\
    \ first car from the first list has a lower number than the first car from the\
    \ second list, the first car from the first list has already passed all the cars\
    \ from the second list and the collisions with that car are done. In case the\
    \ first car from the first list has a higher number than the first car from the\
    \ second list, the first car from the second list has already passed all the cars\
    \ from the first list and the collisions with that car are done.\nI tested the\
    \ function and it works correctly.  However, I can see two flaws with this approach:\n\
    \nIt's not very efficient:  the complexity seems to be O(n^2).\nIt's not very\
    \ elegant:  the code is long and the logic is hard to grasp.\n\nI want to make\
    \ the algorithm shorter, simpler and more efficient.  What do you suggest?\n\n\
    \nA:\n\nI think that both of your problems can be solved at once by thinking of\
    \ the problem as a sorting exercise. In other words, for each car on the left\
    \ side, count how many cars on the right have a lower number. Then multiply by\
    \ two, since each pair of cars is counted twice, once from each side. \nThis can\
    \ be done in O(n log n) time, which is about as good as you can do for a comparison-based\
    \ sort. The code is short and should be easy to understand. \n<code>(define (car-race-collision\

    The standard answer is $n(n-1)/2$ but I'm having trouble understanding what the\

    \ solution would be to make a list of the left-to-right moving cars, then go through\
    \ the other list of cars and see if any of them are colliding with any of the\
    \ cars in the first list. This can be done in O(n^2) time, but requires O(n) space\

    \ be something like this:\n<code>(define (car_race_collision n)\n  (for/fold ([num-collisions\

    \ different solution, you could use a <code>for/sum</code>, which already returns\

    \ Thanks for the help!\n\n\nA:\n\nExercise: Before you read this answer, try to\
    \ solve this problem on your own. I'm sure you will learn more by attempting it\
    \ yourself.\n\nAs the comments suggested, this problem can be solved efficiently\
    \ using binary search. One way to think about this problem is to imagine the road\
    \ as a number line. The moving cars are going to be points moving on this number\
    \ line.\nImagine we have n cars going left to right. We can think of these cars\
    \ as points moving from x to y. We do the same for the cars going right to left\
    \ (y to x). We can sort the cars going left to right in increasing order (A1,\
    \ A2, ..., An). And the cars going right to left in decreasing order (B1, B2,\
    \ ..., Bn).\nThis problem can be solved by finding the number of cars that would\
    \ collide if we merge the two sorted lists and then iterating over the merged\
    \ list to count the number of collisions.\nThe naive solution would look something\
    \ like this:\n<code>(define (merge-count l1 l2)\n  (let loop ([l1 l1] [l2 l2]\
    \ [count 0])\n    (cond\n      [(empty? l1) (+ count (length l2))]\n      [(empty?\
    \ l2) (+ count (length l1))]\n      [(&lt; (car l1) (car l2)) (loop (cdr l1) l2\
    \ (+ count (length l2)))]\n      [else (loop l1 (cdr l2) (+ count (length l1)))])))\n\

    \ l1 l2)\n  (let loop ([l1 l1] [l2 l2] [count 0])\n    (cond\n      [(empty? l1)\
