    \n\nA:\n\nThe problem is that your <code>balance</code> variable is not what you\
    \ think it is. In this line:\n<code>(let ([balance (+ (car operations) (second\
    \ below_zero (cdr operations)))]\n</code>\nyou are calling <code>below_zero</code>\
    \ and passing the arguments <code>(cdr operations)</code>. You are not calculating\
    \ the balance for the <code>operations</code> list, you are calculating the balance\
    \ for a list of <code>rest</code> values.\nIf you want to write a helper function\
    \ to calculate the balance, you can do it like this:\n<code>(define (balance-helper\
    \ operations)\n  (cond\n    [(null? operations) 0]\n    [else (+ (car operations)\
    \ (balance-helper (cdr operations)))]))\n</code>\nThen you can use that in <code>below_zero</code>\
    \ like this:\n<code>(define (below_zero operations)\n  (let ([balance (balance-helper\
    \ operations)])\n    (if (&lt; balance 0)\n        #t\n        #f)))\n</code>\n\
    Or you can rewrite <code>below_zero</code> to include the balance calculation\
    \ like this:\n<code>(define (below_zero operations)\n  (cond\n    [(null? operations)\
    \ #f]\n    [(&lt; (car operations) 0) #t]\n    [else (below_zero (cdr operations))]))\n\
    </code>\nor like this:\n<code>(define (below_zero operations)\n  (if (null? operations)\n\
    \      #f\n      (let ([balance (+ (car operations) (below_zero (cdr operations)))])\n\

    The above works, but I'm very curious as to whether it is idiomatic, efficient,\
    \ or elegant. I'm guessing the last two are mutually exclusive, though I'm not\
    \ sure.\nIn particular, I'm curious about the use of <code>apply</code> and nested\
    \ <code>if</code>s. I know that nesting <code>if</code>s could be avoided by using\
    \ <code>cond</code>, but I'm not sure how that would impact efficiency, or whether\
    \ there's any other alternative that might be more idiomatic. I'm also worried\
    \ about the use of <code>apply</code>, because I believe that the operations list\
    \ could be pretty large and apply might cause a stack overflow. Can anyone confirm?\n\
    Please note that this is a learning exercise, and I don't want the solution to\
    \ be trivialized by the fact that I could have used the higher-order functions\
    \ <code>some</code> or <code>any</code>. I'm specifically looking for a solution\
    \ using only control structures.\n\n\nA:\n\nIt is not idiomatic, since it is a\
    \ direct translation of a while-loop.  Here is a more idiomatic way to do this,\
    \ that is also probably more efficient:\n<code>(define (below-zero lst)\n  (if\
