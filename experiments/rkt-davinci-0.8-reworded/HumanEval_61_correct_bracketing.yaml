    \ on <code>\"()\"</code> because it is a string, not a list. Last, you passed\
    \ the list in reversed order, which is not right either.\nI will ignore those\
    \ errors and go further. The main problem is the logic used to check that the\
    \ brackets are correct. The last condition fails because the code does not check\
    \ whether the first character of <code>chars</code> is \")\", which is the only\
    \ case where you can check the first character of <code>first chars</code>. The\
    \ code should check that condition before the \"(\" case and before the \"empty?\"\

    \ \"count\" the opening and closing parentheses. For example, you can use a <code>+</code>\
    \ if you see an opening parentheses, and a <code>-</code> if you see a closing\
    \ parentheses. Remember that the count must be non-negative, and in the end it\
    \ should be zero. Example:\n<code>(define (correct-bracketing s)\n  (let loop\
    \ ([i 0] [count 0])\n    (cond [(equal? i (string-length s))\n            (zero?\

    \ <code>brackets</code> input.\nThe first problem is that <code>cond</code> needs\
    \ a final clause that handles all other cases, otherwise it will silently fail\

    ```\n*Another important consideration is the fact that Racket uses a different\
    \ `=` operator. Racket's `=` does reference equality, but probably not in the\
    \ way you're used to. In Python, `is` is used for object identity. In Racket,\
    \ `eq?` is used for object identity. `=` is a different operator that compares\
    \ two values to determine if they are the same. `=` will return `#t` if the two\
    \ values are equal, but not necessarily the same object.*\n\n# Coding Guideliness\n\

    \ Do I need <code>local</code> or <code>define</code> or something else?\n\n\n\
    A:\n\nWell, you can do this with regular recursion. For example, if you take a\
    \ bracket string like <code>\"()(())\"</code>, you can imagine iterating over\
    \ it, making sure that each <code>)</code> matches a corresponding <code>(</code>.\
    \ You can't just look for the matching <code>(</code> for each <code>)</code>,\
    \ though, because the <code>)</code> might be the matching parentheses for a <code>(</code>\
    \ earlier in the string. \nSo, you can imagine keeping track of the number of\
    \ matching open parentheses that you've seen so far as you go through the string.\
    \ So, for example, if you're on <code>\")\"</code>, then there should be exactly\
    \ one <code>\"(\"</code> in the string before it. It's easy to do this with a\
    \ counter, which starts at 0 and counts up for each <code>\"(</code> and down\
    \ for each <code>)\"</code> that you see. It's also easy to do recursively, by\
    \ passing along the number of open parentheses that you've seen so far, and then\
    \ calling the function recursively on the remainder of the string if you've seen\
    \ at least one <code>\"(</code> before each <code>)\"</code> that you see, or\
    \ returning false if you see a <code>)\"</code> before a <code>\"(</code>. Something\
