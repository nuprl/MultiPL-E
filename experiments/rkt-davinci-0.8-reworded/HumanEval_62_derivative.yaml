    \n\nA:\n\nThis is just an answer to show you how to test functions that have multiple\
    \ outputs, which you can use to test your own function.\nOne way to test a function\
    \ is to not write the function and then test that, but instead to write the test\
    \ first. This is called test-driven development.\nHere, I'm going to write a function\
    \ that takes two numbers, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and returns two numbers:\
    \ <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. This is a silly function and not something\
    \ you'd ever actually write. But it does demonstrate how to test functions that\
    \ return multiple values.\nHere is my test:\n<code>(check-expect (pair-returner\
    \ 1 2) (list 1 2))\n</code>\nThis says that when I call <code>pair-returner</code>\
    \ with 1 and 2 as arguments, I should get a list containing 1 and 2.\nNow I need\
    \ to write the function.\n<code>(define (pair-returner a b)\n  (list a b))\n</code>\n\
    I run the program, and I get an error. What's wrong?\n<code>pair-returner: contract\
