    \ is a concept where a function calls itself. I understand the basics of it, but\
    \ this is one of those where I don't even know where to start.\nI'm starting to\
    \ feel like I'm a master at for-loops, how to iterate through data structures,\
    \ etc. However, I'm still struggling with recursion, so any help or suggestions\
    \ would be greatly appreciated.\nEdit\nFor this assignment, I can't use any functions\
    \ from Racket except <code>empty?</code>, <code>first</code>, and <code>rest</code>.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nThe basic idea of recursion is that you break down a complex problem\
    \ into its parts.  Each part is then handled separately.  When the problem is\
    \ \"done\", its results are combined with the results of other parts, to get the\
    \ total result.\nSo, in your example, the problem of finding the sum of squares\
    \ of the numbers in the list that are odd could be broken down in several ways.\
    \  Here are two.\nFor each number in the list, test if it is odd, and if so, square\
    \ it and add to the total.  The code might look like this:\n<code>(define (f lst)\n\
    \  (cond\n    [(empty? lst) 0]\n    [(even? (first lst)) (f (rest lst))]\n   \
    \ [else (+ (square (first lst)) (f (rest lst)))]))\n</code>\nThe test <code>(even?\
    \ (first lst))</code> tests if the number is even and returns <code>#t</code>\
    \ or <code>#f</code>.  In other words, it returns <code>#t</code> if the number\
    \ is even.  The <code>cond</code> function checks the list of test/result expressions,\
    \ and if the test evaluates to <code>#t</code>, then that test's result is returned.\
    \  In other words, if the test is <code>(even? (first lst))</code> and the number\
    \ is even, then the result <code>(f (rest lst))</code>", "  (sum-odd-squares lst))\n",
  "  (if (null? lst)\n      0\n      (+ (* (car lst) (car lst))\n         (double_the_difference\
    \ (cdr lst)))))\n</code>\nI know I can use the <code>cond</code> function to do\
    \ this with checks for each edge case, but is there a way to do it with the <code>if</code>\
    \ function?\nHere is what I have so far, but this doesn't get the expected behavior\
    \ at all.\n<code>#lang racket\n", "  (define (square x) (* x x))\n  (if (empty?\

    \ to go through every element in the list, and if it's positive and odd, then\
    \ you square it. You then sum all the squared numbers, and double the result.\n\
    However, the output I'm getting is always 0. I've written a few simple helper\
    \ functions, <code>odd?</code> and <code>square</code> (yes, I know they're built-in,\
    \ but I wanted to write them myself anyway), and they work perfectly fine. \n\
    I believe my <code>double_the_difference</code> function is correct, as I've tried\
    \ a few inputs, and it seems to work fine, it's just that it always returns 0.\
    \ The code at the end that says <code>0</code> seems to be executing, even when\
    \ the list is not empty. It's probably something simple, but I can't see it.\n\
    \n\nA:\n\nYour problem is that you're accumulating values from the last to the\
    \ first position in the list, but the recursive call is at the end of the code:\n\
    <code>(+ (* (car lst) (car lst))\n   (double_the_difference (cdr lst)))\n</code>\n\
    That way the values from the tail are processed after the whole computation is\
    \ finished. To fix this, reverse the list before processing it, it's that simple:\n\
    <code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n  (cond [(empty? lst) 0]\n        [else\n\

    I'm very new to Racket and have not seen <code>cond</code> syntax before. Can\
    \ someone explain what's going on here?\n\n\nA:\n\nA <code>cond</code> is basically\
    \ a set of boolean tests, for each test you have a pair of expressions. The first\
    \ expression is tested and if it evaluates to a non-false value, the second expression\
    \ is executed and evaluated, and its value is returned. In other words, it's like\
    \ a fancy <code>if</code>, with multiple clauses.\nFor example, let's say we have\
    \ a <code>cond</code> like this:\n<code>(cond\n  [(= 1 2)\n   'a]\n  [(= 3 3)\n\
    \   'b]\n  [else\n   'c])\n</code>\nThe first clause tests for <code>(= 1 2)</code>,\
    \ which is false. The second clause tests for <code>(= 3 3)</code>, which is true.\
    \ So the <code>'b</code> symbol is evaluated and returned. The <code>else</code>\
    \ clause is always evaluated last, if all the previous conditions fail.\n", " \

    </code>\nI've tried to follow the instructions on the HtDP website, but I still\
    \ can't get my head around some of the problems.\nI assume that <code>double_the_difference</code>\
    \ is the same as <code>sum_of_squares_of_odd_numbers</code> (the function name\
    \ in the instructions) that I have to define, but I'm not sure what to do with\
    \ the <code>list</code> object in the examples.\nIf I run <code>(double_the_difference\
    \ '(list 1 3 2 0))</code> in the shell, I get a <code>define: unbound identifier\
    \ in module in: list</code> error.\nSo what's <code>list</code> exactly? I've\
    \ never seen the <code>'</code> used in this way before. Is it some kind of shortcut?\n\
    I know that <code>'(1 2 3)</code> is the same as <code>(list 1 2 3)</code>, but\
    \ what about <code>'(list 1 2 3)</code>?\n\n\nA:\n\nFirst of all, the interpreter\
    \ is already defined for you. It is called <code>list</code>. You never need to\
    \ define it yourself. So, your function definition is actually fine.\nSecond,\
    \ from the code you posted, it seems you are confused about the <code>list</code>\
    \ function. It is pretty simple. The function <code>list</code> takes any number\
    \ of parameters, and it returns a list with those parameters. For example, <code>(list\
    \ 1 3 2 0)</code> gives <code>(1 3 2 0)</code>, <code>(list -1 -2 0)</code> gives\
    \ <code>(-1 -2 0)</code>, and so on. The examples in the question are just calling\
    \ <code>list</code> with a single parameter, which is itself a list. So, <code>(list\

    \ is a function, but it is not the argument that you want.\nWhat you need to do\
    \ is use the syntax for variable substitution. In Racket, variable substitution\
    \ is done with <code>#%app</code>. It looks like this:\n<code>(#%app f x)\n</code>\n\
    What this does is it treats <code>f</code> as a variable and substitutes it in\
    \ the place of <code>#%app</code> to get <code>(f x)</code>. You can use this\
    \ to pass <code>odd?</code> as a function to <code>filter</code>. However, you\
    \ will still get an error because you are still passing the wrong number of arguments\

    \ How could I improve this code?\n\n\nA:\n\nYou can make your code a little shorter\
    \ by using <code>foldl</code> to implement double_the_difference. This is because\
    \ the <code>fold</code> functions work by calling the supplied function with two\
    \ arguments, each of which is an element from the list, or from either of the\
    \ two lists in the case of fold-left/right. This means you can use foldl to sum\
    \ the squares of the odd integers:\n<code>(define (double_the_difference lst)\n\
    \  (if (null? lst) 0\n      (* 2 (foldl + 0\n                   (map square\n\
    \                        (filter odd? lst))))))\n</code>\nThe <code>if</code>\
    \ conditional is redundant because <code>foldl</code> and the other <code>fold</code>\
    \ functions return their initial value if the supplied list is empty, so the <code>if</code>\
    \ condition can be replaced with an <code>and</code> to check that <code>foldl</code>\
    \ is actually returning a non-empty list.\n<code>(define (double_the_difference\
