    The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = 1\nF(n)\
    \ = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)\n\nwhere F(0) is 0 and F(1) is 1.\n\nThe first few terms\
    \ of the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nBy\
    \ starting with F(1), we reach the second term of the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,\
    \ 13, ...\n\nBy starting with F(2), we reach the third term of the sequence: 2,\
    \ 8, 13, 21, ...\n\nBy repeatedly applying F(n - 1) we reach the nth term of the\
    \ sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nFor example, to\
    \ calculate F(10), we first apply F(9), which gives us 1 and then apply F(8),\
    \ which gives us 1 + 1 = 2; finally, we apply F(7), which gives us 1 + 2 = 3 and\
    \ so on.\n\nFind the sum of all the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence whose first\
    \ 10 digits in the sequence are 1 and whose last 10 digits in the sequence are\
    \ 4.\n\nExample\nFor F(10) = 147 and F(9) = 1, we have:\n\nF(10) = 147\nF(9) =\
    \ 1 + 1 = 2\nF(8) = 1 + 2 = 3\nF(7) = 1 + 3 = 4\nF(6) = 1 + 4 = 5\nF(5) = 1 +\
    \ 5 = 6\nF(4) = 1 + 6 = 7\nF(3) = 1 + 7 = 8\nF(2) = 1 + 8 = 9\nF(1) = 1 + 9 =\
    \ 10\nF(0) = 1 + 10 = 11\n\nThe sum of these numbers is 3 + 7 + 10 = 38.\n\nThe\
    \ sum of F(10) and F(9) is 3 + 7 = 9 and F(10) and F(9) have the same last 10\
    \ digits in the sequence and so they add up to 10. Similarly, the sum of F(8)\
    \ and F(7) is 3 + 7 = 9 and F(8) and F(7) have the same last 10 digits in the\
    \ sequence and so they add up to 10. Finally, the sum of F(6) and F(5) is 3 +\
    \ 7 = 9 and F(6) and F(5) have the same last 10 digits in the sequence ", "  \
