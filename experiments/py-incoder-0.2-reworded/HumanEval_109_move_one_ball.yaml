  \   \"\"\"We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n\
  \    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if\n\
  \    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing\
  \ \n    the following operation on the given array:\n        You are allowed to\
  \ perform right shift operation any number of times.\n    \n    One right shift\
  \ operation means shifting all elements of the array by one\n    position in the\
  \ right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to\n    the starting\
  \ position in the array i.e. 0th index. \n\n    If it is possible to obtain the\
  \ sorted array by performing the above operation\n    then return True else return\
  \ False.\n    If the given array is empty then return True.\n\n    Note: The given\
  \ list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\n    For Example:\n    \n    >>>\
  \ move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])\n    True\n    Explanation: By performin 2 right\
  \ shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n                 be achieved for the\
  \ given array.\n    >>> move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])\n    False\n    Explanation:It\
