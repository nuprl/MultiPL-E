    Problem 7: Deposit Operation\nWrite a function that takes in a list of deposit\
    \ operations and returns the sum of all deposit operations.\n\nThe deposit operation\
    \ takes in an amount and a description of the deposit. The description can be\
    \ anything you want, but make sure to include a description for every deposit\
    \ operation.\n\nThe function should return None if there are no deposit operations,\
    \ or if the deposit operation amount is negative.\n\n>>> deposit_operations =\
