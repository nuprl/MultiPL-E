prompt: "def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's\
  \ a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;\
  \  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The\
  \ two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move\
  \ in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving\
  \ left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are\
  \ infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their\
  \ trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number\
  \ of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n"
