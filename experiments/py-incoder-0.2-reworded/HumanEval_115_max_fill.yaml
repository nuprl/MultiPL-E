    Solution\nLet's see how we can solve this problem using dynamic programming.\n\
    \nThe idea is to build a table that stores the number of ways to lower the buckets\
    \ until we reach the capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is initialized with\
    \ all zeros, except the entry for the first bucket that has a value of 1.\n\n\
    The idea is to iterate over all rows and columns of the grid, and for each cell\
    \ that has a value of 1, we update the table to reflect the number of ways to\
    \ lower the bucket until we reach the capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is\
    \ then updated with the number of ways to lower the bucket until we reach the\
    \ capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is then updated with the number of ways\
    \ to lower the bucket until we reach the capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table\
    \ is then updated with the number of ways to lower the bucket until we reach the\
    \ capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is then updated with the number of ways\
    \ to lower the bucket until we reach the capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table\
    \ is then updated with the number of ways to lower the bucket until we reach the\
    \ capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is then updated with the number of ways\
    \ to lower the bucket until we reach the capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table\
    \ is then updated with the number of ways to lower the bucket until we reach the\
    \ capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is then updated with the number of ways\
    \ to lower the bucket until we reach the capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table\
    \ is then updated with the number of ways to lower the bucket until we reach the\
    \ capacity of the bucket.\n\nThe table is then updated with the number of ways\
