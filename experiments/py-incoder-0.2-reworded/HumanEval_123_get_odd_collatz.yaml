  \  \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd\
  \ numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in\
  \ mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any positive\
  \ integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows:\
  \ if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous\
  \ term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n   \
  \ term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will\
