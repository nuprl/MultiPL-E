    \ 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1\n\
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)\n\nFor example, F(10) = 55 and F(100) = 99.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(0), you can calculate the sequence F(n) by adding the previous two numbers\
    \ in the sequence.\n\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8)\nF(100) = F(99) + F(98)\nF(1000) = F(999)\
    \ + F(998)\n...\nF(10000) = F(9999) + F(99999)\nF(100000) F(1000000)\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(1), you can calculate the sequence F(n) by adding the previous two numbers\
    \ in the sequence.\n\nF(1) = F(0) + F(1)\nF(2) = F(1) + F(0)\nF(3) = F(2) + F(1)\n\
    F(4) = F(3) + F(2)\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3)\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4)\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5)\n\
    F(8) = F(7) + F(6)\nF(9) = F(8) + F(7)\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8)\nF(100) = F(10) +\
    \ F(9)\nF(1000) = F(100) + F(10)\n...\nF(10000) = F(1000) + F(100)\nF(100000)\
    \ F(1000000)\n\nBy considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values\
    \ do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.\n\nThe sum\
    \ of even Fibonacci numbers is F(1000000).\n\nFor example, as 1, 3, 5, 9, 13,\
    \ \u2026 show, F(1000000) = (1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 13 + \u2026 + 4000001) mod 1000000.\n\
    \nHence the sum of even Fibonacci numbers is F(1000000) = (1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 13\
    \ + \u2026 + 4000001) % 1000000 = F(4000001) % 1000000 = F(40000000).\n\nFind\

    Problem 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0, F(1)\
    \ = 1\nF(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), where F(0) = F(1) = 1 and F(1) = 0.\n\nThe\
    \ first few terms of the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\
    \ 144, ...\n\nBy starting with F(1), you can compute the next term in the sequence:\
    \ \nF(2) = F(1) + F(0) => F(3) = F(2) + F(1) => F(4) = F(3) + F(2) => ...\nBy\
    \ repeating this process, eventually you will reach the term which has \nthe Fibonacci\
    \ sequence name: F(n) = 3^n.\n\nFor example, the 6th term of the sequence is 8.\n\
    \nFind the next term in the Fibonacci sequence to obtain the number \nwhich results\
    \ from applying the formula F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2).\n\n\n</text>\n<cell>",

    <cell>\nget_max_triples(5)\n</cell>\n<text>\nProblem 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence\
    \ is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = 1\nF(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)\n\
    \nwhere F(0) is 1 and F(1) is 1.\n\nBy starting with F(1), you can compute the\
    \ sequence F(n) by repeatedly applying F(n - 1) and\nF(n - 2).\n\nFor example,\
    \ F(10) = F(9) + F(8) + F(7) + F(6) + F(5) + F(4) + F(3) + F(2) + F(1) + F(0).\n\
    \nThe first ten terms will be:\n\nF(0) = 1\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 1\nF(3) = 2\nF(4)\
    \ = 3\nF(5) = 5\nF(6) = 7\nF(7) = 14\nF(8) = 21\nF(9) = 41\nF(10) = 71\n\nBy concatenating\
    \ (joining) the sequences F(9), F(8) and F(7), you get the following sequence:\n\
    \nF(10) = F(9) + F(8) + F(7) = 144 + 211 + 343 = 463\nThe greatest product of\
    \ three consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number that \nends with 463 is 144.\
