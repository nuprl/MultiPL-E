    \ 8\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the formula:\n\nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1\n\
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)\n\nFor example, F(10) = 55 and F(100) = 99.\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(0), you can calculate the sequence F(n) by adding the previous two numbers\
    \ in the sequence.\n\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8)\nF(100) = F(99) + F(98)\nF(1000) = F(999)\
    \ + F(998)\n...\nF(10000) = F(9999) + F(99999)\nF(100000) F(1000000)\n\nBy starting\
    \ with F(1), you can calculate the sequence F(n) by adding the previous two numbers\
    \ in the sequence.\n\nF(1) = F(0) + F(1)\nF(2) = F(1) + F(0)\nF(3) = F(2) + F(1)\n\
    F(4) = F(3) + F(2)\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3)\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4)\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5)\n\
    F(8) = F(7) + F(6)\nF(9) = F(8) + F(7)\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8)\nF(100) = F(10) +\
    \ F(9)\nF(1000) = F(100) + F(10)\n...\nF(10000) = F(1000) + F(100)\nF(100000)\
    \ F(1000000)\n\nBy considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values\
    \ do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.\n\nThe sum\
    \ of even Fibonacci numbers is F(1000000).\n\nFor example, as 1, 3, 5, 9, 13,\
    \ \u2026 show, F(1000000) = (1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 13 + \u2026 + 4000001) mod 1000000.\n\
    \nHence the sum of even Fibonacci numbers is F(1000000) = (1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 13\
    \ + \u2026 + 4000001) % 1000000 = F(4000001) % 1000000 = F(40000000).\n\nFind\
