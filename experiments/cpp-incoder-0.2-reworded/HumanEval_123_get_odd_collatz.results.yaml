    \ The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence\
    \ defined\n// as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is\

    \ the next term is one half of \n// the previous term. If the previous term is\
    \ odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n// term plus 1. The conjecture is\
    \ that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n// Note:\
