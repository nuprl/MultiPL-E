    \ n, return a sorted vector that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n//\
    \ The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence\
    \ defined\n// as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is\
    \ obtained from the \n// previous term as follows: if the previous term is even,\
    \ the next term is one half of \n// the previous term. If the previous term is\
    \ odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n// term plus 1. The conjecture is\
    \ that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n// Note:\
    \ \n// 1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n// 2. returned vector sorted in increasing order.\n\
    // For example:\n// get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for\
    \ 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n// >>> get_odd_collatz((5))\n\
