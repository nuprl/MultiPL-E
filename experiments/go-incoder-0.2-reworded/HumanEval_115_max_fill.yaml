    Thanks for your answer. Can you please explain how you came up with the solution?\
    \ I understand that it is O(n^2) but I don't understand how you came up with that\
    \ solution. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used a map to count the number of each\
    \ value in the grid. Then, I used a loop to find the max number of each value\
    \ in the map. Finally, I subtracted the max number of each value in the map from\
    \ the max number of each value in the grid. Hope it helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\

    Great! Now you know how to use max_fill to solve the problem of filling wells.\n\
    \n\n</text>\n<text>\nPart Two\nNow let's see how we can use max_fill to solve\
    \ the second part of our homework problem. We'll use the same grid as before,\
    \ but this time we'll use it to fill the wells until we run out of water.\n\n\
    The second part of our homework problem asks you to fill the wells until we run\
    \ out of water. We'll use a similar approach as before, except that instead of\
    \ using a bucket to extract water, we'll use a queue to extract water until we\
    \ run out of water.\n\nTo help you understand how this works, let's imagine that\
    \ we have two wells A and B, and that we can extract water from A into B. We'll\
    \ then add A to the queue and extract water from B into A. Now we can repeat this\
    \ process until we run out of water.\n\nThe queue is represented as a 2-dimensional\
    \ array, and each cell contains a 0 or 1. When we extract water from the well,\
    \ we add 1 to the corresponding cell in the queue. When we run out of water, we\
    \ remove 1 from the corresponding cell in the queue.\n\nFor example, if we have\
    \ the following queue:\n\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1],\n [1, 1]]\nThen we can extract water\
    \ from well 0 into well 1 by adding 1 to cell [0, 0] and removing 1 from cell\
    \ [0, 1]. After extracting 1 from cell [0, 0], we have the following queue:\n\n\
    [[0, 0],\n [1, 0],\n [0, 1]]\nWe can then extract water from well 1 into well\
    \ 0 by adding 1 to cell [1, 0] and removing 1 from cell [1, 1]. After extracting\
    \ 1 from cell [1, 0], we have the following queue:\n\n[[0, 0],\n [0, 1],\n [0,\
    \ 1]]\nWe can then extract water from well 0 into well 1 by adding 1 to cell [0,\
    \ 1] and removing 1 from cell [1, 1]. ", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\

    \ |>\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\nLet dp[i][j] denote\
    \ the maximum number of water that can be extracted from bucket i using bucket\
    \ j.\nInitially, the answer is 0.\nFor each bucket i, we know that dp[i][j] =\
    \ max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), where dp[i-1][j] denotes the maximum number of\
    \ water that can be extracted from bucket i using bucket j-1 and dp[i][j-1] denotes\
    \ the maximum number of water that can be extracted from bucket i using bucket\
    \ j-1.\nThe answer is then dp[grid.length][grid[0].length].\n<|/ a dscore=0 |>\n\

    \ Using Dynamic Programming (DP)\nThe above solution uses recursion to solve the\
    \ problem. Dynamic programming (DP) is a recursive algorithm that solves the same\
    \ problem using smaller subproblems. You can read more about it here.\n\nThe idea\
    \ is to keep track of the largest amount of water you can extract from each well.\
    \ Initially, we can assume that we can extract water from each well and store\
    \ it in a 2D array called dp[][]. Then, we can keep track of the largest amount\
    \ of water we can extract from each well using another 2D array called max[][].\
    \ At each step, we update max[][] by adding the largest amount of water we can\
    \ extract from each well in each step.\n\nThe base case is when we have an empty\
    \ grid. Since we have no water we can extract from any well, we return 0.\n\n\
    The recursive case is when we have water we can extract from each well. We can\
    \ either extract water from the wells we have already extracted water from or\
    \ we can extract water from the wells we can extract water from. In the latter\
    \ case, we need to update the max[][] array by adding the largest amount of water\
    \ we can extract from each well in each step.\n\nThe idea is to keep track of\
