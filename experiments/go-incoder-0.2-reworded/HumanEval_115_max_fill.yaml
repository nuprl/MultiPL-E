    Thanks for your answer. Can you please explain how you came up with the solution?\
    \ I understand that it is O(n^2) but I don't understand how you came up with that\
    \ solution. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used a map to count the number of each\
    \ value in the grid. Then, I used a loop to find the max number of each value\
    \ in the map. Finally, I subtracted the max number of each value in the map from\
    \ the max number of each value in the grid. Hope it helps.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
