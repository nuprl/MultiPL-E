    <|/ a tags=go |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer, but i don't understand why\
    \ you use strings.Split(s, \" \") to split string into array?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c\
    \ |>\nBecause the string may contain more than one space between words. So `strings.Split(s,\
    \ \" \")` will split it into an array with each word as a separate element.\n\
