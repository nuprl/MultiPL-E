    \ new to golang and I am still trying to understand how it works. I understand\
    \ that you are splitting the string into an array of words. But what is the purpose\
    \ of bored_words?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nbored_words is a slice of strings. I used\
    \ it to avoid having to iterate over each word in the string multiple times. I\
    \ added some comments to my answer to explain what each line does.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThank you so much for the explanation. I understand it better now. One\
    \ last question, why are you using bored_count := 0? Why not just use bored_count\
    \ := 1?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nBecause the bored count starts at 0, and you only\
    \ want to count boredoms that start with the word \"I\". So you start counting\
    \ at 1, and increment it each time you find a boredom that starts with \"I\".\n\
