  \ a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n// each\
  \ cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n// inclusive\
  \ appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n// You have to find the minimum\
  \ path of length k in the grid. You can start\n// from any cell, and in each step\
  \ you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n// in other words, you can go to cells\
  \ which share an edge with you current\n// cell.\n// Please note that a path of\
  \ length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n// necessarily distinct).\n// You\
  \ CANNOT go off the grid.\n// A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path\
  \ B (of length k) if\n// after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells\
  \ that A and B go\n// through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically\
  \ less\n// than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <=\
  \ k)\n// such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n// lst_A[j]\
  \ = lst_B[j].\n// It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n// Return an ordered\
  \ list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n// Examples:\
