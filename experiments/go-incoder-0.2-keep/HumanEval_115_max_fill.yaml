  \ You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,\n\
  // and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.\n// Each well has a corresponding\
  \ bucket that can be used to extract water from it, \n// and all buckets have the\
  \ same capacity.\n// Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.\n// Output\
  \ the number of times you need to lower the buckets.\n// Example 1:\n// Input: \n\
  // grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]\n// bucket_capacity : 1\n// Output:\
  \ 6\n// Example 2:\n// Input: \n// grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]\n\
  // bucket_capacity : 2\n// Output: 5\n// Example 3:\n// Input: \n// grid : [[0,0,0],\
  \ [0,0,0]]\n// bucket_capacity : 5\n// Output: 0\n// Constraints:\n// * all wells\
  \ have the same length\n// * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2\n// * 1 <= grid[:,1].length\

    \ So the capacity is how many units of water you can extract from the wells. So\
    \ the capacity is how many units of water you can extract from the wells. So the\
    \ capacity is how many units of water you can extract from the wells. So the capacity\
    \ is how many units of water you can extract from the wells. So the capacity is\
    \ how many units of water you can extract from the wells. So the capacity is how\
