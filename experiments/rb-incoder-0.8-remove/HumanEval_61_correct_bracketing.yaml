    <| c |>\nSorry for the late reply, and thanks for taking the time to look at this.\
    \ I tried running your code, but I get an error when trying to run the ruby file.\
    \ It says that \"stack\" is not defined (I'm using IRB). I'm assuming that is\
    \ because you changed your bracketing from my original code to the one you provided.\
    \ Any suggestions?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nWell, yes, I did change it! :) I changed\
    \ my code slightly, but otherwise it's pretty much the same as the original code.\
    \ Stack is a global variable defined at the top of the code, but my function just\
    \ operates on local variables. I also renamed the local variable brackets to bracket_stack,\
    \ and added a couple more lines to check whether `brackets` is a string.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your quick response. Just to clarify, when I run the\
    \ ruby code, where I do \"print correct_bracketing(brackets)\", I'm still getting\
    \ an error. I'm assuming it's because I'm not defining stack? When I define it\
    \ within the function, it works. Do you think that's the reason it isn't working?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSorry, I forgot that I'd been modifying the code from the question.\
    \ I fixed it now. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nOk, thanks for the quick response.\
    \ When I run your updated code (including the brackets check), I get an error\
    \ saying \"SyntaxError ((irb):24: syntax error, unexpected tLABEL, expecting keyword_end)\"\
    \ Any ideas on what this means?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nI recommend using Racket for\
    \ this; it has a lot of useful facilities for working with these kinds of things.\
    \ Here is an example that takes a string with parentheses and returns a list consisting\

    \ whether any were needed or not:\n<code>", "  bracket_stack = brackets\n  while\

    \    if open_count == 0\n      bracket_stack.pop\n      return\n    end\n    close_count\
    \ =\n      get_bracket(match_bracket).count('(') - get_bracket(match_bracket).count(')')\
    \ - open_count\n    if close_count == 0\n      bracket_stack.pop\n    else\n \

    \     brackets =~ /^#{opening_bracket}#{closing_bracket}$/\n    end\n  end\nend\n\
    </code>\nThen we get the following example test cases:\n<code>\n[\n  \"(()()())\"\
    ,\n  \"((()))\",\n  \"(())\",\n  \"()()\",\n  \"(())()\"\n].each do |input|\n\
    \  puts \"'#{input}' should be correct.\"\n  puts input if correct_bracketing(input)\n\
