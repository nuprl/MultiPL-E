    Your issue seems to be that your application is trying to execute fib at class\
    \ definition time. So instead of \n<code>", "    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a < n\n\
    \       a, b = b, a + b\n    end\n    return b\nend\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<| c |>\n\
    What is your solution for Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 30? Is it the recursive\
    \ one?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe recursive solution is `fib_rec`, which calls itself\
    \ until `n < 2`. The first `if` statement is `if n == 1`, which returns the value\
    \ `1`. As `n` increases greater, the value returned by the next `if` statement\
    \ becomes the new `n` and is passed to the next call.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nNice!\
    \ But could you explain the nature of the `end` keyword at the end please? Why\
    \ not simply `fib` instead of `fib_rec`?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThat is just an idiom\
    \ for closing the `while` loop.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nTo be clear, is the `end`\
    \ keyword really necessary? Why does Ruby allow code without it? Is this just\
    \ Ruby style? It seems to me that it is unnecessary, and that it would be more\
    \ clear if you left it out. Does it make any difference to the execution of the\
    \ code?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2 tags=ruby,recursion |>\nIf all you want to do\
    \ is return the nth Fibonacci number, there's no need for recursion:\n<code>",
