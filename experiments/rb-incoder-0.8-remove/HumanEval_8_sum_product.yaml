    \ do anything special with your array of numbers or a loop. The result would just\

    \ sum and product for a given list. To calculate the sum of a list of numbers,\

    \ the function would raise an exception, which will require us to add error handling.\
    \ \nWhat if numbers contained integers within our desired range?\nTo address this\
    \ issue, we can use the fact that when numbers=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] we know\
    \ that we can't get a product of 1 (the product of a list of integers is always\
