    \    sum + 1 if char.kind_of? Integer\n  end\nend\n</code>\nThe function above\
    \ returns the length of the string in bytes. To get the length of characters,\
    \ you can do:\n<code>\nstrlen(\"Hello\")", "  if string == nil then\n    string\
    \ = \"\"\n  end\n  if string.empty?\n    return 0\n  end\n  return string.to_s.length\n\

    \ Kernel.puts to dump the line into a StringIO instance:\n<code>\nio = StringIO.new\n\
    io.puts File.read(\"foo.txt\")\n</code>\nNow, I can get the string version of\
    \ the file using Kernel.eval:\n<code>\nio.eval('string')", "  string.size\nend",
  "   string.count(\"\\n\")\nend\n</code>\nand in main:\n<code>\n$> ruby test.rb \n\
    test1\ntest2\ntest3\n4\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=ruby dscore=0 |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\n\
    Using a variable for the count can be handy but can also be avoided if you're\
    \ not going to use it for anything but its value.  For this simple use case, a\
    \ global variable is fine, but you can get problems with thread-safety if you\
    \ use it for multiple things.\nTo avoid this problem, you can assign a local variable\
    \ and pass it by reference.  As an example that would work best if you were counting\
    \ lines in a file, here is a function that will return the line count as a global\
    \ variable:\n<code>", "  string.split.length\nend", "    return string.size\n\
    end\n</code>\nI tested these methods in my browser with Ruby 1.8.7 but I think\

    <| c |>\nWhy do people use String#gsub with no arguments, and String#split? The\
    \ former seems redundant, especially when your regex matches only whitespace (\\\
    s+).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, it's redundant. But the question was, \"How do I\
    \ do this with Regexp?\". Also, gsub can take two arguments: the first is what\
    \ you want to replace, and the second is what to replace it with.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 |>\nI like the answer by J\xF6rg W Mittag\n<code>\n\"one fish two\
    \ fish red fish blue fish\".split.length\n</code>\nThe split method returns an\
    \ array of strings (in this case there's only one string but that could be more\
    \ if a regex was used to match multiple strings). \nThe length method returns\
    \ the length of the array.\nThe gsub method will replace every occurrence of the\
    \ regex passed as parameter with the second parameter. In this case the second\
    \ parameter is ' '.\nThe gsub method takes the regex and the second parameter\
    \ as the two string that are replacing the regex match and will return the string.\
    \ But what if the regex is not replaced then it will return the string as is.\
    \ This is what it does. \nSo in summary split will split the string by whitespace\
    \ and gsub will replace the whitespace with an empty string ''. \nThe split method\
    \ will give an array and gsub will return the length of the array.\n<|/ a tags=ruby,regex\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n: Yes, but it's still a string in Ruby, and it's a very handy\
