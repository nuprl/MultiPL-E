    \ Here, I'm saying that sum_to_n takes one parameter, so it can be called as sum_to_n(42).\n\
    Next, we need a function that takes a variable number of arguments and returns\

    <| a |>\nThe only real solution is to either use to_a or iterate through each\
    \ element and add them together. Here's a solution I came up with using to_a:\n\
    <code>", "  sum = 0\n  1.upto(n) do |i|\n    sum += i\n  end\n  sum\nend\n</code>\n\
    What is this code? Well, it is an infinite loop (the loop starts with i = 1, and\
    \ increments i up to n).\n<code>\nputs \"n = #{n}, sum is = #{sum_to_n(n)}\"\n\
    </code>\nWhat does it print? Well, the first line prints the value of n and the\
    \ sum of the numbers up to n. The second line prints the sum of the numbers up\
    \ to n. The third line prints the value of sum, and finally, the loop continues.\
    \ Infinite loop!\nYou can see that the loop never ends. Therefore, sum_to_n always\
    \ returns the same value, n. Notice that n will never change, because no matter\
    \ how you change the code, the loop will never end. Consequently, sum_to_n returns\
    \ the same value!\nAs I said earlier, the problem with sum_to_n is that it never\
    \ ends. Therefore, it is impossible to calculate the value of sum.\nThe problem\
    \ is that the sum formula is wrong. Let's change it for simplicity. Let's say\
    \ we want to sum up all the numbers from 1 to n. How can we do this? We can use\
    \ a formula. Let me try it! The formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression\
    \ is\n<code>\n(n * sum( i^(n-i) )) + ((n-1)/n)\n</code>\nLet's try to calculate\
    \ this!\n<code>", "  sum = 0\n  for i in 1..n\n    sum += i\n  end\n  sum\nend",

    The above is pretty simple, but will blow up quickly when given very large numbers.\
