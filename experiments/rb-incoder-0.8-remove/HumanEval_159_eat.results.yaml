    \ I can't really figure out how to do that lol.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's kind\
    \ of like you have a `while` loop that is going to keep looping while a certain\
    \ condition is true, and you need to use a `return` statement to exit out of that\
    \ loop. I suggest using a `print` statement to print the values of variables so\
    \ you can visualize what's happening.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSo if I wanted to write\
    \ a method that returns the amount of carrots you would have eat in your meals,\
    \ would I simply have that return method call a method like I have above, or would\
    \ I rewrite it all into the eat method?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI would just have\
    \ your return statement inside the `if` statement in the method I wrote above.\
    \ That way, if you return `nil`, that means the other conditions aren't met and\
    \ the method will return an array.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI'm sorry, I just don't\

    \ seen the eating of a specific number of carrots, you're ready to do the same\
    \ for finding a hungry Rabbit!\nAs you know, the number of carrots left in a day's\
    \ meals is represented as a binary number, such as 1001 or 1111.\nThe binary number\
    \ consists of a single '1' or '0' depending on whether you're hungry or not.\n\
    For example:\n1001 indicates you're hungry\n1111 indicates you're not hungry\n\
    In the eating function, you should return the index of the hungry Rabbit.\nYou\
    \ will first need to write a binary search algorithm, which will be able to locate\
    \ a specific value in a sorted array.\nThe algorithm should return the index of\
    \ the Rabbit if the value exists in the sorted array, and -1 otherwise.\nIf the\
    \ array is not sorted, return -1.\nIn other words:\nThe algorithm should return\
    \ the first index of the Rabbit if it is found in the sorted array, and -1 otherwise\n\
    Note that your solution should run in O(logN) time, where N is the number of carrots\
    \ left.\nYou cannot use loops for this algorithm.\nNote that if your array only\
    \ consists of a single element, such as the number 4, the algorithm should return\
    \ 4.\nThe algorithm should run in O(logN) time, where N is the number of carrots\
    \ left.\nThere are many ways you can implement binary search. One of the most\
    \ efficient ways is using a divide and conquer approach.\nrequire 'test/unit'\n\

    \ help, much appreciated! So I understand that the array should store the variables\
    \ cost, remaining, but what I am struggling with is how and where to actually\
    \ execute the code in the function? I have read through some tutorials but it\
    \ seems like they just confuse me more. I am a beginner at coding so I am trying\
    \ to get it down to a very simple level before moving onto complex methods. Any\
    \ ideas? Any help would be much appreciated!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=arrays,ruby\
    \ |>\nYou are a beginner and you are struggling with arrays. I suggest you start\
    \ learning Ruby from a book or tutorial. Read a book about programming in Ruby.\
    \ I recommend you Learn Ruby From A Beginner's Perspective by Zed Shaw. Start\
    \ from chapter 1.\nThere are a lot of things that are wrong in your code. For\
    \ example, your method eats should return an array of two values. It should return\
    \ an array of two values. The first value should be the total cost of eating and\
    \ the second value should be the number of carrots left. Also the method eat should\
    \ always return the cost of eating. The number of carrots should always go down\
    \ if you eat all the carrots. If the cost of eating is zero, all remaining carrots\
    \ should not be eaten. I wrote your method eat below. I suggest you do the exercise\
    \ and try to understand each line of your code before writing anything else.\n\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nVery good explanation. One small thing: it looks like you renamed\
    \ `remaining` to `@remaining`. What happens if `@need` is negative? You end up\
    \ with an empty array in that case.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nGood catch. I changed\
    \ the code so that it will only push `@number[i]` if it is not greater than the\

    \ or equal to `@need`, it won't add anything to `carrots`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=2\

    \ I'm trying to wrap my mind around the ruby code and how it works. I'm still\
    \ confused as to how you come up with the variable \"total\", and how you arrive\
    \ at the answer \"[total, left - remaining]\". Where are these numbers coming\
    \ from? How do you know the answer is [total, left - remaining]? What is the purpose\
    \ of the \"for loop\" portion? I'm just not understanding how the code is working,\
    \ and how I arrive at the answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`total` is the sum of `number`\
    \ of carrots you have eaten. `left` is the number of remaining carrots that you\
    \ still need to eat. `[total, left - remaining]` is the answer you're looking\
    \ for. `for i in 1..need` is the loop that you use to go through `need` number\
    \ of times because `need` is the number of carrots you need to eat.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nOh ok, I see now, thank you! I understand now, but I'm still not understanding\
    \ how you arrive at the answer \"[total, left - remaining]\" in the first place?\
    \ How do you know what numbers total and left are coming from without knowing\
    \ how many iterations the loop runs? Can you elaborate on that? Also, do you think\
    \ you could explain the \"for i in 1..need\" part and why you need the loop?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I understand how you arrive at that answer. I was wondering\
    \ how you came up with that answer and why you needed the loop. I understand the\
    \ purpose of the loop, but I still don't understand how you arrive at the answer\
    \ \"[total, left - remaining]\" in the first place.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`[total,\
    \ left - remaining]` is a [2 item array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-25)\
    \ and it's being returned at the end. `for i in 1..need` is essentially a loop\
    \ from 1 to `need`, but in a Ruby style. You may want to do some tutorials about\
    \ loops [like this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm).\n<|/ c\
