    <p>\n    In the second example, notice how we used Ruby's built-in methods instead\
    \ of writing a loop. \n    Since Ruby arrays are objects, we can use methods to\
    \ access their members. \n    We will also use the same built-in method to do\
    \ the calculation. \n    We also have Ruby give us a way to access each array\
    \ element as an integer, \n    which we will need in order to perform calculations.\
    \ \n    By using each and index, we can cycle through each element and do the\
    \ calculations at the same time.\n    It is important to know how this works because\
    \ we will use it to fix the bug that our last example had,\n    which was that\
    \ when the user entered a correct guess, the loop stopped after the first iteration.\n\
