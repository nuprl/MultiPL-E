    \ row represents a well and each column represents some capacity of a well. In\
    \ each row we write 0 or 1 depending upon whether we are holding water or no water.\
    \ At any point in time we have written 1 or more 0s. We need to write 0s until\
    \ there are no 1s. \nWe start with a matrix of n rows and m columns. We start\
    \ with the top most row and bottom most column and we decrement the top row and\
    \ decrement the bottom row. After writing all the 0s we increment the top row\
    \ and increment the bottom row. Repeat the process till we reach the top. After\
    \ we reach the bottom row we decrement the top row and increment the bottom row\
    \ till we are able to write 0s in each row. \n<code>\n static void Main(string[]\

    \ algorithm in the answer\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 tags=python |>\nI wrote a solution\
    \ that is based on the assumption that the given grid is rectangular and non-empty.\
    \  That is, each row has the same number of columns, and each column is empty\
    \ except at the start of the row.  This assumption lets us start by looking at\
    \ the last row (which would be the top most column on the first row in the given\
    \ grid), and work backwards to the first row (the bottom most column on the last\
    \ row).  This would give us a grid that has more columns in each row, than any\
    \ other row on the given grid.  We then can iterate over the columns on the given\
    \ row to see if the column is empty, and if it is empty we can increase the count\
    \ of non-empty columns by 1 (or decrease the count by 1 if it is non-empty).\n\

    \ water into it, we need to take the water from the bucket that is empty in the\

    \ what we want). In the second row, the bucket is empty in the bottom row, so\
    \ we can't take water from it too (well (1, 2) will be full with water, which\
