    A more elegant and more efficient solution to this problem would be to use a Bloom\
    \ filter. This is a data structure that allows you to test if a number is really\
    \ prime or not, without having to store any numbers.\nA Bloom filter can be used\
    \ for a fast prime number checking, so you can use this to check your numbers\
    \ in about O(1) time.\nThe ruby implementation would be as follows:\n<code>\n\
