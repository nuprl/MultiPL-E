    Then we can test the function as follows:\n<code>\n>> add(1, 2)\nx + y is 3\n\

    \ it from the command-line. For example:\n<code>", "  # Add two numbers\n  return\
    \ x + y\nend", "  x + y\nend", "  sum = x + y\n  return sum\nend\n</code>\nWhen\

    The output will be:\n<code>\nadd(1, 2)\n=> 3\n</code>\nThe function call add will\

    \ Functions are defined separately in Ruby with the def keyword, arguments are\
    \ passed with parentheses, not brackets, and the return statement is implied.\

    \ x+y instead of x+y.\nWe could have changed the function like this:\n<code>",
  "  return x + y\nend", "  return x + y\nend", "  return x + y\nend", "  if x < y\n\
    \    x + y\n  else\n    x - y\n  end\nend\n</cell>\n<cell>\nadd(4, 2)\n</cell>\n\

    \ call that looks like this\n<code>\nadd(x, y)\n</code>\nWhat you need is a way\
    \ to get the values of x and y from the function call. The way to do this is by\
    \ storing the function in a variable.\n<code>", "  return x + y\nend\n</code>\n\
    The function body is executed when it is called. To define a function, you can\
    \ use one of these two syntaxes:\n<code>", "    sum = x + y\n    return sum\n\
    end", "  x + y\nend\n</code>\nAnd we get:\n<code>\n> add(3, 4)\n=> 7\n> add(2,\

    \ return x + y\nend\nx = 1\ny = 2", "  x + y\nend", "  result = x + y\nend\n</code>\n\
    The only difference is that this does not require an assignment in the caller\
    \ of a method (it just returns the value). Another advantage is that the caller\
    \ does not need to know what type of value the method is going to return. This\
    \ is also a disadvantage, since it makes the method more generic. As you can see,\
    \ adding numbers and strings is very easy to implement, but the code for the addition\
    \ method will be very different.\nThe same goes for other types. The difference\
    \ is what are you going to do with them? For numbers, you can just add them. For\
    \ strings, you can concatenate them. For all other types, you will have to implement\
    \ an additional method. This is called overloading. You can find more information\
    \ here.\nWhat about functions?\nFunctions in Ruby are first class objects. You\
    \ can pass functions as arguments to other functions. This is very similar to\

    \ Basically, the function `add()` calls itself, passing the values `x` and `y`\
    \ as parameters. Think of it as \"add\" being called in the context of another\
    \ function, passing the `x` and `y` as parameters. Then the function `add()` returns\

  "  return x + y\nend\n</code>\nIn this example, add takes two parameters x and y.\
    \ These parameters must be given by Ruby syntax, as opposed to Python. Ruby calls\
    \ this syntax the \"call by name\" syntax.\nWhen you call a Ruby method, Ruby\
    \ will assign the first parameter passed to the method to the local variable x;\
    \ Ruby will assign the second parameter passed to the method to the local variable\
    \ y; then it returns the sum of those two values as its return value. That return\
    \ value is automatically assigned to whatever variable you call the method on.\n\
    The only thing that Ruby does with method parameters is to assign the parameter\
    \ values to the local variables. You do not need to declare the parameters in\
    \ Ruby before calling the method. If you call the method with too many parameters,\
    \ Ruby will automatically throw a SyntaxError exception stating that there are\
    \ too many parameters passed to a method.\nRuby also allows you to declare a local\
    \ variable before calling a method. This local variable is called an \"instance\
    \ variable\", and is available to the method in whatever scope it resides in.\
    \ Ruby also allows you to declare a local variable before calling a method. This\
    \ local variable is called a \"local variable\", and is available only within\
    \ the method that declares it.\nThese two concepts make it easier to understand\
    \ how Ruby methods work. However, they do not quite work in Python. Let's look\
