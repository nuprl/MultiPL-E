    \ you so much!! That was very helpful. Could you please help me understand how\
    \ you would go about doing this on paper? I can't really figure out how to do\
    \ that lol.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nIt's kind of like you have a `while` loop that\
    \ is going to keep looping while a certain condition is true, and you need to\
    \ use a `return` statement to exit out of that loop. I suggest using a `print`\
    \ statement to print the values of variables so you can visualize what's happening.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nSo if I wanted to write a method that returns the amount of\
    \ carrots you would have eat in your meals, would I simply have that return method\
    \ call a method like I have above, or would I rewrite it all into the eat method?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI would just have your return statement inside the `if` statement\
    \ in the method I wrote above. That way, if you return `nil`, that means the other\
    \ conditions aren't met and the method will return an array.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    I'm sorry, I just don't know enough to figure out how to do that yet. I don't\
    \ really know what a method is yet, but I will do some more reading on that. Thank\
    \ you so much for all your help!\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 tags=ruby |>\nOkay,\

    <text>\nPart 2: Binary Search\nNow that you've seen the eating of a specific number\
    \ of carrots, you're ready to do the same for finding a hungry Rabbit!\nAs you\
    \ know, the number of carrots left in a day's meals is represented as a binary\
    \ number, such as 1001 or 1111.\nThe binary number consists of a single '1' or\
    \ '0' depending on whether you're hungry or not.\nFor example:\n1001 indicates\
    \ you're hungry\n1111 indicates you're not hungry\nIn the eating function, you\
    \ should return the index of the hungry Rabbit.\nYou will first need to write\
    \ a binary search algorithm, which will be able to locate a specific value in\
    \ a sorted array.\nThe algorithm should return the index of the Rabbit if the\
    \ value exists in the sorted array, and -1 otherwise.\nIf the array is not sorted,\
    \ return -1.\nIn other words:\nThe algorithm should return the first index of\
    \ the Rabbit if it is found in the sorted array, and -1 otherwise\nNote that your\
    \ solution should run in O(logN) time, where N is the number of carrots left.\n\
    You cannot use loops for this algorithm.\nNote that if your array only consists\
    \ of a single element, such as the number 4, the algorithm should return 4.\n\
    The algorithm should run in O(logN) time, where N is the number of carrots left.\n\
    There are many ways you can implement binary search. One of the most efficient\
    \ ways is using a divide and conquer approach.", "  list = []\n  i = 0\n  while\
    \ i < number\n    if need[i - 1] > 0\n      list << i\n      need -= i \n    end\n\

    \ to wrap my mind around the ruby code and how it works. I'm still confused as\
    \ to how you come up with the variable \"total\", and how you arrive at the answer\
    \ \"[total, left - remaining]\". Where are these numbers coming from? How do you\
    \ know the answer is [total, left - remaining]? What is the purpose of the \"\
    for loop\" portion? I'm just not understanding how the code is working, and how\
    \ I arrive at the answer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`total` is the sum of `number` of\
    \ carrots you have eaten. `left` is the number of remaining carrots that you still\
    \ need to eat. `[total, left - remaining]` is the answer you're looking for. `for\
    \ i in 1..need` is the loop that you use to go through `need` number of times\
    \ because `need` is the number of carrots you need to eat.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Oh ok, I see now, thank you! I understand now, but I'm still not understanding\
    \ how you arrive at the answer \"[total, left - remaining]\" in the first place?\
    \ How do you know what numbers total and left are coming from without knowing\
    \ how many iterations the loop runs? Can you elaborate on that? Also, do you think\
    \ you could explain the \"for i in 1..need\" part and why you need the loop?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I understand how you arrive at that answer. I was wondering\
    \ how you came up with that answer and why you needed the loop. I understand the\
    \ purpose of the loop, but I still don't understand how you arrive at the answer\
    \ \"[total, left - remaining]\" in the first place.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`[total,\
    \ left - remaining]` is a [2 item array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-25)\
    \ and it's being returned at the end. `for i in 1..need` is essentially a loop\
