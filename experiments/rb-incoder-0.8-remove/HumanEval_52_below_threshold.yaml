    The above can be made much more efficient, by using a Set instead of an Array.\
    \  Also, it is a good idea to use local variables instead of global variables,\

    That's a better solution and easier to read, but OP wants a more general solution ",

    \ It looks like it just wraps up the `all?` method with an `if`\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nI agree, but then I felt this way it's more clear what exactly it does,\
    \ and it's shorter (less characters). I also added a link to the docs, where it\
    \ states \"If called with a block, returns true if the block evaluates to true\
    \ for every element in the collection\"\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe code is shorter\
    \ and clearer, yes. But how does it solve the problem? It doesn't answer what\
    \ the OP asked, which is *\"I want to see if a collection of numbers is below\
    \ threshold\"*. That's all. Besides, your example is very poor. You could write\
    \ `if l.all? { |n| n < threshold }` which is much better. And btw. `all?` does\
    \ not require to sort the collection to avoid the overhead of a more complicated\
    \ `select` call.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with you, and I added some more explanations.\
    \ I hope that helps to understand\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`all?` is **not** more complex\
    \ than `select` in most cases. It does not require to sort the collection when\
    \ no block is given. Btw. `select` does not sort the collection.\n<|/ c |>\n<|\
    \ a dscore=0 |>\nYou can use the minmax! method defined in Enumerable :\n<code>\n\
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].minmax! { |a, b| a <=> b }", "    l.each do |x|\n        return\
    \ false if t > x\n    end\n    return true\nend\n</code>\nThe last one is just\
    \ an exercise left to the reader, which should look something like this:\n<code>",
  "  return not all((t-l) > 0)\nend", "    # Write your code here.\n    false = l.size\
    \ <= t\n    return false\nend", "    l.sort!\n    l == [] || t.nil? || t.zero?\n\

    \ do |x|\n        if x < t\n            return false\n        end\n    end\n \
    \   return true\nend", "\tl.each do |i|\n\t\treturn false if i < t\n\tend\n\t\
    return true\nend", "  l.all? do |x| \n    x < t \n  end\nend", "  l.each do |x|\n\
    \    next false if (x < t)\n    next false if (x.odd?)\n    break true\n  end\n\
    \  false\nend", "    l.each do |i|\n        return false if i < t\n    end\n \
    \   return true\nend", "  return l.all? { |x| x > t }\nend", "  return l.map{|x|\
    \ x <= t} == false\nend", "  l2 = []\n  \n  for number in l\n    l2.push(number\
    \ - t)\n  end", "    l.sort!\n    return l.all? { |e| e < t }\nend\n</code>\n\
    This will return true for all integers less than or equal to 100.  It will also\
    \ return false for empty lists and nil values, etc.  It will also return false\
    \ if the list is all zero, which is probably not what you want.\nFor efficiency,\
    \ you may want to write your own sort.  For example:\n<code>", "  l.all? { |x|\
    \ x < t }\nend\n</code>\nLet's use that in a test suite:\n<code>\ndescribe \"\
    #below_threshold\" do\n  describe \"with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]\" do\n \
    \   it \"returns true if all numbers are below threshold\" do\n      expect(below_threshold([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],\
    \ 10))?.to be true\n    end", "  l.all? { |x| x < t }\nend", "    return all(n\
    \ < t for n in l)\n</code>\nNow you can just use these three functions to build\
    \ your solution easily.\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| a tags=java,python,algorithm |>\n\
    In Java we could use stream API to achieve this.\n<code>\npublic boolean isUnderThreshold(List<Double>\
    \ list, double threshold) {\n        return list.stream().allMatch(d -> d <= threshold);\n\
    }\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| a tags=java,python,algorithm |>\nThe way that\
    \ I normally implement this problem is to start with a Boolean that determines\
    \ if the list is above or below the threshold. Then for each element in the list,\
    \ I check if it is above or below the threshold and if either of those conditions\
    \ are true I change the Boolean variable to reflect that it's below the threshold.\
    \ If none of the elements are above or below the threshold, the Boolean will always\
    \ be false. You can then return the Boolean at the end of the function or return\
    \ true.\nIn Java:\n<code>\npublic static boolean isUnderThreshold(double value)\
    \ {\n    boolean isBelow = true;\n    for (double number : numbers) {\n      \
    \  if (number > threshold) {\n            isBelow = false;\n        }\n    }",
  "  l.each { |n| return false if n.to_i < t }\n  true\nend\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=0\
    \ |>\n<| a |>\n<code>", "  l.all? { |x| x <= t }\nend", "\tl.each do |i|\n\t\t\
    return true if i < t\n\tend\n\tfalse\nend", "    count = 0\n    l.each do |n|\n\
    \        if n <= t\n            count += 1\n        end\n    end\n    count >=\
    \ 0\nend", "  l.all? do |x|\n    x.negative? && x.abs < t\n  end\nend\n</code>\n\
    The above will return true if all numbers in list l are below threshold t. To\
    \ count how many numbers are below threshold t, you can use:\n<code>", "    below_threshold(l,\
    \ nil, t) # Default to nil threshold if none given.\nend", "  l.all? { |e| e <\
    \ t }\nend", "    l.any? { |x| x < t }\nend", "  l.all? { |x| x < t }\nend\n</code>\n\
    As far as your other method goes, it looks like you want to find the first element\
    \ that satisfies some condition.  There are a number of ways of doing this, the\
    \ simplest of which is probably to use the select method on Array:\n<code>", " \
    \ l.all? {|el| el < t}\nend", "  l.reduce(:<, t)\nend", "  l.each do |item|\n\
    \    return false if item.to_i < t\n  end\n  true\nend\n</code>\n<|/ a |>\n<|\
    \ c |>\nThanks for the thorough explanation.  I really appreciate it!\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a dscore=0 |>\nA simple method would be:\n<code>", "  l.all? { |i| i < t }\n\
    end", "  return l.all? { |n| n < t }\nend", "    l.sort == t\n    l.all? {|x|\
    \ x < t }\nend\n</code>\nOr more tersely:\n<code>", "    l.all? { |i| i < t }\n\
    end", "  # Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.\n \
    \ return l.all? { |x| (x<t) == false }\nend", "  l.each do |num|\n    return false\
    \ unless num < t\n  end\n  true\nend", "  l.all? { |x| x < t }\nend", "  l.all?\
    \ {|x| x < t}\nend", "  l.all?{ |x| (x - t).abs <= t }\nend", "  l.all? { |i|\
    \ i < t }\nend\n</code>\nAnd now we can write:\n<code>", "\tl = l.to_a\n\tl.each\
    \ {|x| return false if t < x}\n\ttrue\nend", "    l.sort\n    below_threshold(l,t-1)\

    \ look at the element (by `el`) and the index (by `i`) at the same time. `select`\
    \ gives you the chance to look at both the element and the index separately, but\
    \ that may be confusing (as I did above). `reject` gives you the chance to look\
    \ at both separately, but if you get it wrong, it will be hard to debug (as you\
    \ did above).\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks again for your explanation. I agree with\

    \ all? and it's fixed in Ruby 1.9.x.  Here's a version that works on Ruby 1.8.x\
