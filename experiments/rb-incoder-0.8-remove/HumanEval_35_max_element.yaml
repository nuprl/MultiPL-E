    \ a |>\nIf you have a big list then you may want to use an Array rather than an\
    \ Array:\n<code>\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\narray.select { |x| x >\
    \ 5 }.min", "  l.sort!\n  l.last\nend", "  l.sort.last \nend", "  l.sort!\n  l.last\

    <| c |>\nThe idea of using sort to find the highest element is a very good one\
    \ (except that `max_element` can easily be done in O(n) time with `l.sort!`).\
    \  However, you have a bug in the `return` statement: `return nil unless l.size\
    \ > 0`.  Without this change, `max_element` will always return `nil`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nthanks for catching that. I updated the code above. Not sure where my\
    \ bug was, but it was late and I was tired and didn't want to run it in a code\
    \ editor to find it out.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a |>\nIf you're looking for a function\
    \ that finds the maximum element in a collection, there are two ways to do it.\
    \  \nThe first is to write an O(n) function to iterate through the collection\
    \ until you find the element you want to find and return the value (or nil if\
    \ none are found).  \nThe second is to sort it and then iterate through the collection\
    \ until you find the element you want to find.  \nRuby comes with both functions,\
    \ and their implementations are very similar.\n<code>\n def max_element(collection)\n\
    \  collection.sort!.last if collection.size > 0\n end\n</code>\nIf you really\
    \ want to make it a one-liner, you can use the max_by method as well.  \n<code>\n\
    collection.max_by { |x| x.to_i }\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=algorithm,ruby,data-structures\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nGood point Chris, I didn't consider that.  You could return\
    \ the first element if collection is empty, but that wouldn't be a good solution.\

    \ c |>\n<| a tags=sorting,ruby,arrays |>\nSorting with sort_by is faster because\
    \ it is built into Ruby.  Your benchmark is flawed in that the comparison method\
    \ used (sort_by {|a,b| a.b <=> b.b}) does an unnecessary comparison.  Instead\
    \ of sorting the array it creates a new array, and then sorts that array, which\
    \ means an extra sort.\n<|/ a dscore=2 |>\n<| c |>\nHmmm, I thought sort_by was\
    \ only sorting on the basis of a single attribute, rather than a whole array at\
    \ once. Is there a way to pass it an array of elements to sort, and tell it to\
    \ sort on more than one attribute? And why is sorting in O(nlogn) faster than\
    \ the sort method I use?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added a test to the top of my benchmark\
    \ test to show that there is an extra (unnecessary) sort.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    Ah, I think I understand now. The extra sort is actually done by the `sort_by`\
    \ method because you pass in an array. When the method receives a single element\
    \ to sort, it checks to see if that element already exists in the new array, and\
    \ if so, does nothing.\n<|/ c |>\n<| a tags=sorting,ruby,arrays |>\nI think the\
    \ problem with sort_by is that it sorts by the whole object, but your sorting\
    \ method just compares two things. You should be able to do:\n<code>\nl.sort_by{|a|\

    \ is indeed a good solution for Ruby 1.9+, which is what the question was tagged\
    \ with.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI think you should update that last line to say `Hash#values_at`\
    \ instead of `Hash#last`. It's an important distinction between `Hash#last` and\
    \ `Hash#last` (like `Hash#sort` vs `Hash#sort!`). Also `Hash#values_at` will give\
    \ you a copy of the values in the array, which may be undesirable.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| a tags=arrays,ruby |>\nRuby has array#last which returns the last element.\

    The ruby way would be to use Enumerable#max_by, which also avoids the creation\
    \ of a temporary array.\n<code>\n> [1,2,3,4,5].max_by { |e| e**2 }\n=> 15\n</code>\n\
    Note that max_by is available as of Ruby 2.3 and so may not yet be in your default\
    \ Ruby environment.\n<|/ a dscore=3 |>\n<| c |>\nNote that `max_by` has changed\
    \ in Ruby 2.3; it now returns a `Hash` rather than the element (`max_by` returns\
    \ an element if all elements pass the block to `max_by`, but `max_by` now returns\
    \ a hash with the element as the key). For example, `[3, 2, 1].max_by { |e| e\
    \ ** 2 }` returns `{3=>3, 2=>2}` rather than `{3=>3, 2=>1, 1=>1}`.\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThe Hash is more efficient than Array's last method, as shown [here](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html#method-i-report),\
    \ but the return value is not the same, which is why the last example in my answer\
    \ doesn't return the element. The return value of the Hash is more efficient because\
    \ it doesn't have to sort all elements, but it still sorts the elements and returns\
    \ the greatest element only.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks. I was also curious about\
