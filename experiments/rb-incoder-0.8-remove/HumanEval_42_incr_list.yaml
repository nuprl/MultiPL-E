    \ from start to end. For example incr_list([]) will return the empty list [],\

    \ dscore=1 |>\nI'm going to try to explain by giving an example to demonstrate\
    \ how you can manipulate arrays in Ruby.\nLet's say you are given an array arr\
    \ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and you want to add 3 at the end of this array. \nWhat you\
    \ would want to do is:\n<code>\narr = arr.push(3) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code>\n\
    The push() function simply adds one element to the end of an array and returns\
    \ this array. Because it returns the array, it can be assigned to a variable,\
    \ but you don't have to do that. \nThe same principle can be used for inserting\
    \ elements in different positions:\n<code>\narr.insert(2, 5) # => [1, 2, 5, 3,\
    \ 4, 5]\narr.insert(0, 5) # => [5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n</code>\nThe insert()function\
    \ also returns the new array, so you can reassign a variable to the return of\
    \ this function. But you don't have to do that either. \nAnd the same principle\
    \ can be used for removing elements from an array: \n<code>\narr.pop # => [1,\
    \ 4, 5]\n</code>\npop() removes the last element and returns it (which is the\
    \ deleted element).\n<code>\narr.pop(1) # => [4, 5]\n</code>\npop() removes the\
    \ element at the specified position and returns it (which is the deleted element).\n\
    The same principle can be used for removing the first n elements from an array:\n\
    <code>\narr.delete_at 0 # => [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n</code>\ndelete_at() removes the\
    \ first n elements and returns the deleted elements. \n<code>\narr.delete_at(1)\
    \ # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code>\ndelete_at() removes the element at the specified\
    \ position and returns it (which is the deleted element).\n<|/ a tags=ruby,arrays,ruby-on-rails\
    \ |>\n<| a |>\nHere's a way to do this with Ruby.\n<code>\narray = [\"one\", \"\
    two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\"]", "  l.each do |e|\n    e += 1\n  end\n\
    \  l\nend", "  result = []\n  for i in l\n    result << i + 1\n  end\n  result\n\
    end", "    list.each { |x| l = l + [x] }\n    l\nend", "  l.each_with_index do\
    \ |e, i| \n    l[i] = l[i] + 1 \n  end\n  l\nend\n</code>\nThe final step is to\
    \ use a map to apply the incremented value to the original elements:\n<code>",

    \ instead of 1.\nThis is not so difficult; as long as you remember the original\
    \ indices, and only increment each element if the current element is the same\
    \ as its original index.\nThe indices are then just the reverse of the original\
    \ ones, except that any position where the current element is greater than its\
    \ original index should still be incremented by 1.\nThis is what I came up with:\n\

    \ do |sum, i|\n    sum + i\n  end\nend", "  (0...l).map {|i| i + 1}\nend", " \
    \ l2 = []\n  l2.push(l[0])\n  l.shift\n  l.each { |e| l2.push(e) }\n  l2\nend",

    \  end\nend", "  return l + [l[l.length-1] + 1]\nend\n</code>\nNow we can easily\
    \ apply the function to every element of the list. \n<code>\n> incr_list([1,2,3])",
  "  l = l + [1]\nend", "  l.inject([]) { |acc, e| acc + [e+1] }\nend\n</code>\nThe\
    \ above example yields:\n<code>\n1.9.3p327 :008 > incr_list([1,2,3])\n => [1,\

    \ answer. The issue is that the list is actually a custom class which inherits\
    \ from the array class. It's a class that I've written myself and it inherits\
    \ from Array but I could change the code if I wanted to so it inherits from the\
    \ array class but I cannot change the class that inherits from array. Also, since\
    \ my array is going to be used for large numbers, a solution which uses each element\
    \ in the array multiple times would be very time intensive.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n\
    The question is how to write `incr_list` in a way that maintains the efficiency\
    \ of the original implementation. How big is this list? Can you provide us with\
    \ an example?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe list is around 700 elements and contains\
    \ no repeated numbers. It's a large array with lots of duplicates but many of\
    \ them are just single instances. It is used to test an algorithm on a large amount\
    \ of data so a large amount of time is being spent in other methods so it cannot\
    \ be avoided. So, even though I cannot change any of the array methods, I should\
    \ be able to change incr_list\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nPlease see my updated answer,\
    \ I believe that is the best you can get with Ruby as it is written in the question.\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nIf you want an inductive method, you could do:\n<code>",
  "  if l.nil? then return nil\n  return [l.first,incr_list(l.first) + 1]\nend", " \
    \ l\nend\n</code>\n<|/ a dscore=1 |>\n<| a dscore=0 |>\nThis is a really old question,\
    \ but I still found it useful for other reasons.\nIf you are using rails 4.2,\
    \ or above, you can use the .each_with_index method on a collection:\n<code>.each_with_index\
    \ do |element, index|\n  ...\nend\n</code>\n<|/ a tags=ruby |>\n<| a dscore=0\
    \ |>\nJust because you were looking for a list based solution and did not find\
    \ anything I thought I'd chime in with an example of a simple list based solution\
    \ while still keeping a list.\nYou want your list to have some initial state (which\
    \ may or may not already be in it) and you then want to be able to add or remove\
    \ any number of items from it.\nHere is an example of a class that does this in\
    \ Ruby 2.5.0.\n<code>", "    l.each do |x| \n        x.to_i + 1 \n    end \nend",
  "  l.each_with_index { |elem,i| l[i] = elem + 1 }\n  l\nend", "  return l.map {\
    \ |x| x + 1 }\nend", "  ls = l.dup\n  ls.inject([ls.first]){ |sum, n| sum.push(n\
    \ + 1) }\nend", "  l.each do |i|\n    i += 1\n  end\nend", "  l.inject{|sum, i|\
    \ sum+1}\nend", "  l.each do |element|\n    element += 1\n  end\n  l\nend\n</code>\n\

    end", "  l = l + 1 # +1 means increment\nend", "  res = []\n  for i in l\n   \
