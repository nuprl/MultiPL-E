    \ is met because if the balance is less than zero then the program would stop.\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nWhy do you say \"You should use getter and setter methods\" and\
    \ why is that? My understanding is that getters and setters are the way to go\
    \ when the class you're writing is an instance of an existing class. For example,\
    \ one could have a BankAccount class which defines the balance method: `def balance;\
    \ end` And then create a BankAccountWithGetterAndSetter class which defines getter\
    \ and setter methods. So, isn't the whole point of getters and setters to allow\
    \ us to write code as if it were a class?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nGetters and setters\
    \ are a way to provide encapsulation. You should always try to use them. For example,\
    \ if the balance is supposed to be private or protected in the BankAccount class\
    \ (which it should be), you could simply use a private variable and add getter\
    \ and setter methods for that variable so that other classes could change that\
    \ variable, but you couldn't change or read it from outside of the class.\n<|/\
    \ c |>\n<| c |>\nIf your class isn't an instance of an existing class then getters\
    \ and setters wouldn't make any sense. Think of a bank account that doesn't have\
    \ private or protected variables. You could have methods like `balance`, but you\
    \ could also have a method `withdraw` that would change the balance by `amount`,\
    \ so you could call it with `account.withdraw(10)`. But you could also call `account.balance\
    \ = account.balance + 10` so you could have `account.balance += 10`\n<|/ c |>\n\
    <| c |>\nThanks for your responses! It was very helpful to me. :)\n<|/ c |>\n\

    \ you pass the `withdraw_money` and `deposit_money` methods as parameters to your\
    \ `below_zero` method. Then you use those methods in your `each` block to compute\
    \ the balance changes, and then you compare those changes with the `<` operator.\
    \ `below_zero` would return `true` if, and only if, the balance changes were less\

    \ called is below_zero. You will notice that if each of the operations in the\
    \ list has the class Deposit then it can return the result and move on to the\
    \ next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if each of the operations in the list\
    \ has the class Withdraw then it can return the result and move on to the next\
    \ iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if none of the operations in the list has\
    \ the class Deposit or Withdraw then that means there was a Withdraw or Deposit\
    \ operation after the balance check so this loop should return false. Thus, if\
    \ none of the operations in the list has any class other than Deposit and Withdraw\
    \ then each of the operations should have a balance of 0 (or less). Since every\
    \ operation has a balance of 0, there will always be at least one False or True\
    \ result and therefore the function should return true at the very beginning (unless\
    \ there are other operations that have balances greater than zero that I am not\
    \ aware of). Therefore, my below_zero function will always return true if all\
    \ of the operations have a balance of 0, or less, and false otherwise.\n<|/ a\
