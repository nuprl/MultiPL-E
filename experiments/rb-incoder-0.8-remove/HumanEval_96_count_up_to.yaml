    Problem 10: Count the number of prime numbers less than 1000\nThe sieve of Eratosthenes\
    \ (also called a Sieve of Eratosthenes of Sicce or Sieve of Sicce, or Sieve of\
    \ Eratosthenes in Sicce) was introduced by Henrik Bengtsson in his 19th annual\
    \ prime number paper as one of the fastest growing algorithms known off today.\
    \ The basic idea is to generate all prime numbers less than a certain number and\
    \ then filter out the non-prime numbers less than this number. For a number n\
    \ to be prime it has to divide evenly into all numbers that are smaller than it.\
    \ So for e.g. if n is 100 the only prime numbers less than 100 are all factors\
    \ of 100. One could also consider only odd numbers to be primes but this would\
    \ result in some non-prime numbers being counted multiple times. One could think\
    \ of these non-prime numbers as those that would make the filter condition false.",
