    \ for your answer. I've tried your solution and it works perfectly. I've also\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, `array_shift` only works on arrays with one element. `array_shift`\
    \ removes the first element from the array and returns it, so it works on arrays\
    \ with more than one element. Your code doesn't work because you were trying to\
    \ use `array_shift` on an array that didn't have one element (it had two).\n<|/\

    \ c |>\nThank you for your answer! I appreciate it! I understand your solution,\
    \ but I still don't understand how it works. I understand that we are looping\
    \ through the array and checking if the first element is an operation and if so\
    \ adding it to the balance. But I don't understand how we are checking if the\
    \ balance is below zero. How does it know to check the first element in the array?\
    \ And how does it know to check the second element in the array? And how does\
    \ it know to check the third element in the array? And how does it know to check\
    \ the fourth element in the array? And how does it know to check the fifth element\
    \ in the array? And how does it know to check the sixth element in the array?\
    \ And how does it know to check the seventh element in the array? And how does\
    \ it know to check the eight element in the array? And how does it know to check\
    \ the ninth element in the array?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added some comments to\

    The `foreach` loop iterates over the `$operations` array. Each iteration adds\
    \ the current operation to the `$balance` variable. If the current operation is\
    \ negative, the balance is negative, so the function returns `true`. Otherwise,\
    \ the balance is positive, so the function returns `false`. So the function returns\
    \ `true` if the balance is negative and `false` if the balance is positive.\n\
