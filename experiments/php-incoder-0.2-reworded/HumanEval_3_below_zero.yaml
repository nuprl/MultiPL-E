    \ for your answer. I've tried your solution and it works perfectly. I've also\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, `array_shift` only works on arrays with one element. `array_shift`\
    \ removes the first element from the array and returns it, so it works on arrays\
    \ with more than one element. Your code doesn't work because you were trying to\
    \ use `array_shift` on an array that didn't have one element (it had two).\n<|/\
