    \ this solution, however I believe it would be better to return the difference\
    \ between the guess and the score rather than the absolute difference. Otherwise\
    \ the difference between a correct guess and a score of 0 will be counted as a\
    \ correct guess. So the function would look like this: `function compare($game,\
    \ $guess) {\n    $result = [];\n    foreach ($game as $key => $score) {\n    \
    \    $result[$key] = $guess - $score;\n    }\n    return $result;\n}`\n<|/ c |>\n\
