    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for your answer. Your solution is very elegant and\
    \ efficient. However I cannot understand why you used the variable $count and\
    \ $count += 1 instead of just $count++.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe variable $count\
    \ is just to count the number of triples. $count += 1 means $count is incremented\
    \ by 1 before it is returned. Since $count is initialized to 0, the return value\
    \ of get_max_triples() is 1 since there is only one triple of 3 that satisfies\
    \ the conditions.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see. Thank you for your explanation.\n\
