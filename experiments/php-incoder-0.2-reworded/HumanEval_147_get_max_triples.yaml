    <|/ a |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for your answer. Your solution is very elegant and\
    \ efficient. However I cannot understand why you used the variable $count and\
    \ $count += 1 instead of just $count++.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe variable $count\
    \ is just to count the number of triples. $count += 1 means $count is incremented\
    \ by 1 before it is returned. Since $count is initialized to 0, the return value\
    \ of get_max_triples() is 1 since there is only one triple of 3 that satisfies\
    \ the conditions.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see. Thank you for your explanation.\n\

    \ Are you sure you tested it correctly?\n<|/ c |>\n<| a dscore=1 |>\nThis problem\
    \ can be solved using dynamic programming. \nLet us define f(i,j,k) as the number\
    \ of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is\
    \ a multiple of 3.\nThen f(i,j,k) can be calculated using f(i-1,j,k) and f(i,j-1,k)\
    \ where i < j and a[i] < a[j].\nThe base case is f(i,j,k) where a[i] < a[j].\n\
    The recurrence relation is f(i,j,k) = min(f(i-1,j,k), f(i,j-1,k)) where i < j\
    \ and a[i] < a[j].\nThe idea is to calculate f(i,j,k) using previously calculated\
    \ f(i-1,j,k) and f(i,j-1,k) where i < j and a[i] < a[j].\nThe code below implements\
    \ this idea.\n<code>", "    $a = array();\n    for ($i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) {\n\
