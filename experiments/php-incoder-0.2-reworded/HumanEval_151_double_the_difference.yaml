    \ like this solution, but I believe it can be improved. For example, what if the\
    \ input array is empty? Then the function will return 0, which is not what we\
    \ want. Also, the function will have to iterate through the entire array even\
    \ if the first element is a negative number. Instead, we can just iterate through\
    \ the array once, keeping track of the sum of the previous elements. Then we can\
    \ just return the sum of the previous elements. Also, we can just return the sum\
    \ of the previous elements if there are no negative numbers in the array. I'll\
    \ post an answer with these improvements.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your\
