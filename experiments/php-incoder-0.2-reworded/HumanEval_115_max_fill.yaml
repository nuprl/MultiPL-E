    I like your solution, but I believe it can be optimized a little bit more. Since\
    \ you only need to check one cell, you don't need to check all cells. You can\
    \ just check one cell and increment the count if that cell is empty. Also, you\
    \ don't need to check all cells, since you only need to check one cell per row.\
    \ So, you can just check one cell per row and increment the count if that cell\
    \ is empty. Also, you can just check one cell per row and increment the count\
    \ if that cell is full. Also, you don't need to check all cells, since you only\

    This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming in O(n^2) time complexity\
    \ and O(n) space complexity. \nThe idea is to solve the problem using recursion\
    \ and memoization. \nThe base case is when all the elements are filled, then return\
    \ the number of elements. \nThe recursive case is when there is still some element\
    \ to fill. \nThe idea is to fill the element with the largest number of elements\
    \ that can fit in the remaining space. \nThe recursive case can be solved by filling\
    \ the element with the largest number of elements that can fit in the remaining\
    \ space and subtracting the number of elements that can fit in the remaining space\
    \ from the number of elements that can fit in the remaining space. \nThe memoization\
    \ stores the number of elements that can fit in the remaining space for each element\
    \ in the grid. \nThe code below is written in Python. \n<code>\ndef max_fill(dp,\
    \ grid, capacity):\n    if dp[grid[0]] == None:\n        dp[grid[0]] = max_fill_helper(grid,\
    \ capacity)\n    return dp[grid[0]]\n\ndef max_fill_helper(grid, capacity):\n\
    \    ans = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        ans = max(ans, max_fill_helper(row,\
    \ capacity - row[-1]))\n    return ans\n\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    dp\
    \ = [None] * len(grid)\n    return max_fill_helper(grid, capacity)\n\nprint(max_fill(\n\

    \ Can you please explain it a bit?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe idea is simple: you\
    \ have a grid of wells. Each well has a capacity and you need to empty the wells\
    \ until you empty all the wells. So you need a bucket for each well. Initially\
    \ all buckets have the same capacity. Now you just need to fill the buckets until\
    \ you empty all the wells. So you just need to count the number of wells filled\
    \ until you empty all the wells.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your explanation.\

    \ find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\n\nAccording\
    \ to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \u201CThe lowest common ancestor is defined\
    \ between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants\
    \ (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).\u201D\n\nThe function\
    \ LCA(root, p, q) takes in a binary tree root and a node p and another node q\
    \ and returns the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of p and q in the tree or null\
    \ if there is no such LCA between the nodes.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7],\
    \ p = 5, q = 8\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of 5 and 8 is 5, which is the\
    \ root of the binary tree with these two nodes.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7],\
    \ p = 5, q = 4\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of 5 and 4 is 5, which is the\
    \ root of the binary tree with these two nodes.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7],\
    \ p = 6, q = 7\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The LCA of 6 and 7 is 7. The LCA of 5\
    \ and 6 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition\
    \ of LCA.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7],\
    \ p = 6, q = 5\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of 6 and 5 is 5, since a ", " \
