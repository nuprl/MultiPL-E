    Thanks for your answer. I've tried your solution and it works perfectly. I've\
    \ also tried the other solutions posted here and they work too, but I prefer this\
    \ one because it's shorter and easier to understand.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree\
    \ that this is easier to understand, but I find it more difficult to read. Also,\
    \ it doesn't use any built-in PHP functions. I find it more difficult to understand\
    \ what it does and how it does it.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree with you on readability.\
