    \ I tried your solution and it works perfectly. I was wondering if you could explain\
    \ to me why you used the explode function and what it does? I understand that\
    \ it is splitting up the string into an array but I don't understand why you used\
    \ the explode function. Thank you again!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe explode function\
    \ splits a string into an array based on a delimiter (in this case a space). So\
    \ the string \"Hello world\" would be split into an array with two elements: \"\
    Hello\" and \"world\". The explode function also takes an optional second parameter\
    \ that tells it what character to use to split the string into. In this case I\
    \ used a space (\" \"). Hope that helps!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI see. Thank you\

    \ |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the answer. Can you please explain how this works?\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThis code works by splitting the string into chunks of length\
    \ `n`, then it checks each chunk to see if it contains `n` consonants. If it does,\
    \ it adds it to the `$words` array. `$i` keeps track of the current position in\
    \ the string and `$len` keeps track of the length of the string. `$n` can be any\
    \ positive integer.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for the explanation. Can you please\
