  // the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n// if there are not enough remaining\
  \ carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n// Example:\n\
  // * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]\n// * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]\n// * eat(1, 10, 10)\
  \ -> [11, 0]\n// * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n// Variables:\n// @number : integer\n\
  // the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n// @need : integer\n// the number\
  \ of carrots that you need to eat.\n// @remaining : integer\n// the number of remaining\
