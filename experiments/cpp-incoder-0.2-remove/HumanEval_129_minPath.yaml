prompt: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given a grid with N rows\
  \ and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n// each cell of the grid contains\
  \ a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n// inclusive appears exactly once\
  \ on the cells of the grid.\n// You have to find the minimum path of length k in\
  \ the grid. You can start\n// from any cell, and in each step you can move to any\
  \ of the neighbor cells,\n// in other words, you can go to cells which share an\
  \ edge with you current\n// cell.\n// Please note that a path of length k means\
  \ visiting exactly k cells (not\n// necessarily distinct).\n// You CANNOT go off\
  \ the grid.\n// A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length\
  \ k) if\n// after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and\
  \ B go\n// through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically\
  \ less\n// than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <=\
  \ k)\n// such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n// lst_A[j]\
  \ = lst_B[j].\n// It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n// Return an ordered\
  \ list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n// Examples:\n\
