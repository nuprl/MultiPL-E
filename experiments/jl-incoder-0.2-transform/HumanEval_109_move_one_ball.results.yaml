  program: "\"\"\"We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n\
    \    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine\
    \ if\n    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing\
    \ \n    the following operation on the given array:\n        You are allowed to\
    \ perform right shift operation any number of times.\n    \n    One right shift\
    \ operation means shifting all elements of the array by one\n    position in the\
    \ right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to\n    the starting\
    \ position in the array i.e. 0th index. \n\n    If it is possible to obtain the\
    \ sorted array by performing the above operation\n    then return True else return\
    \ False.\n    If the given array is empty then return True.\n\n    Note: The given\
    \ list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\n    For Example:\n    \n    >>>\
