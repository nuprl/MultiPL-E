    <|/ c |>\n<| a tags=julia |>\nThe answer by is correct, but I thought I would\
    \ add some explanation.\nThe reason why your function does not work is because\
    \ you are using an Int64 type for your variables. When you use an Int64 type Julia\
    \ will automatically convert your variables to Int64 types. This is why you were\
    \ getting a type mismatch error. \nIn your function you were trying to use an\
    \ Int64 type for your variables. This is why you were getting a type mismatch\
    \ error. \nIf you were to change your variables to Float64 types you would no\
    \ longer get this error. \n<code>", "    if h < 0\n        error(\"Triangle height\
