    \ 2\nWrite a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of times\
    \ each character appears in the string.\nFor example, if the input string is \"\
    abcabc\", the function should return {\"a\" => 3, \"b\" => 2, \"c\" => 3}.\nIf\
    \ the input string is empty, return an empty dictionary.\nHint: Use a dictionary\
