prompt: "\"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\
  \    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n\
  \    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine\
  \ if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are\
  \ given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows\
  \ a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess\
  \ was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value\
  \ is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    \n    example:\n\
  \n    >>> compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2])\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3,\
