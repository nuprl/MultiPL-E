    a b c\")\n    Dict(\"a\" => 1, \"b\" => 1, \"c\" => 1)\n    >>> count_letters(\"\
    a b b a\")\n    Dict(\"a\" => 2, \"b\" => 2)\n    >>> count_letters(\"a b c a\
    \ b\")\n    Dict(\"a\" => 2, \"b\" => 2)\n    >>> count_letters(\"b b b b a\"\
    )\n    Dict(\"b\" => 4)\n    >>> count_letters(\"\")\n    Dict()"]
