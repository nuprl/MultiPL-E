prompt: "\"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name,\
  \ and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n\
  \    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions\
  \ \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in\
  \ the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The\
  \ substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from\
  \ \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the\
  \ dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\

    \ that takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the\
    \ the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is\
    \ considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n    are\
    \ met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's\
    \ name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring\
    \ before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n    the\
    \ latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the dot should\
    \ be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\

    \ a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns\
    \ 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if\
    \ all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more\
    \ than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains\
    \ exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty,\
    \ and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n\
    \    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n\

    \ representing a file's name, and returns the file's extension.\nA file's extension\
    \ is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions are met:\n\
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's extension.\n\
    - The file's extension contains exactly one dot '.'\n- The substring before the\
    \ dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet\
    \ ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n- The substring after the dot should be one of these:\

    \ that takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the\
    \ the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is\
    \ considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n    are\
    \ met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's\

    \ before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n    the\
    \ latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the dot should\
    \ be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\

    \ representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is\
    \ valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid\
    \ if and only if all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should\
    \ not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's\
    \ name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should\
    \ not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z'\
    \ and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt',\
    \ 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n   \

    Exercise 2: Write a function that takes a string representing a file's name, and\
    \ returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n\
    \    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following\
    \ conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits\
    \ ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot\
    \ '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with\
    \ a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring\
    \ after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n\
    \    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n    \"Yes\"\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\
    1example.dll\")\n    \"No\"\n    \"\"\"", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\

    \ a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns\
    \ 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if\
    \ all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more\
    \ than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains\
    \ exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty,\
    \ and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n\
    \    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n\
    \    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n    \"Yes\"\n    >>>\

    <text>\nExercise 3\nWrite a function that takes a string representing a file's\
    \ name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No'\
    \ otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the\
    \ following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three\
    \ digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly\
    \ one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it\
    \ starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n\
    \    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n\
    \    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n    \"Yes\"\n    >>>\
    \ file_name_check(\"1example.dll\")\n    \"No\"\n    \"\"\"", "    \n    \n  \

    Exercise 2\nWrite a function that takes a string representing a file's name, and\
    \ returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n\
    \    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following\
    \ conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits\
    \ ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot\
    \ '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with\
    \ a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring\
    \ after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n\
    \    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n    \"Yes\"\n    >>> file_name_check(\"\
    1example.dll\")\n    \"No\"\n    \"\"\"", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\

    \ a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns\
    \ 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if\
    \ all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more\
    \ than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains\
    \ exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty,\
    \ and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n\
    \    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n\
    \    Examples:\n    >>> file_name_check(\"example.txt\")\n    \"Yes\"\n    >>>\
