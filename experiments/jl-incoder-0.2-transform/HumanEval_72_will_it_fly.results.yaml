    \ the point of the question. `will_it_fly` should return `true` if the sum of\
    \ its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. Your code\
    \ returns `true` if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum\
    \ possible weight *and* the list itself is balanced.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI agree\
    \ with you. I just wanted to give a solution that is close to OP's code. Maybe\
    \ I misunderstood the question. Anyway, I edited my answer to reflect your comment.\n\
