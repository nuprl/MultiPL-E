    <text>\nThe function minPath takes two arguments: grid and k. The grid is a 2D\
    \ array where each element of the array is a vector with N elements. Each element\
    \ of the vector is a grid cell. k is the length of the path. For example, minPath([[1,\
    \ 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3) returns the path [1, 2, 1]. Note that the path\
    \ returned is a vector, not a list. Also, note that you can only visit each cell\
    \ once. For example, minPath([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 1) returns [1].\
    \ Finally, note that you can visit each cell at most once.\nusing Test\n\n@testset\
