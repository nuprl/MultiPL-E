prompt: "\"\"\" Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.\n\
  \    Algorithm idea is simple:\n    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string\
  \ that is a palindrome.\n    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string\
  \ prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.\n    >>> make_palindrome(\"\"\
