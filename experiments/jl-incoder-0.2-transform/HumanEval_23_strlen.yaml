    I believe this should be the accepted answer. `length` does not require the string\
    \ to be a substring of the other string. `length` returns the number of characters\
    \ in the string. `length` also works on `Char`s.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`length`\
    \ also works on `Char`s, as long as you use `length` on a `Char` rather than a\
