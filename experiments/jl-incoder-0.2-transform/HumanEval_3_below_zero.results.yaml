    Exercise 2\nWrite a function that calculates the number of operations that need\
    \ to be performed on a bank account to\nwithdraw $100. Your function should take\
    \ a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n\
    zero balance. Your function should return an integer that represents the number\
    \ of operations that need to be performed\non a bank account to withdraw $100.\n\
