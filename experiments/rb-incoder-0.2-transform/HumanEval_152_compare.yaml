prompt: "# I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\
  # event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n\
  # definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n# Your task is to determine if a\
  \ person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n# You are given\
  \ two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match.\
  \ \n# Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If\
  \ they have guessed correctly,\n# the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute\
  \ difference between the guess and the score.\n# example:\n# >>> compare.call([1,\
  \ 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2])\n# [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n# >>> compare.call([0,\
