prompt: "# Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians\
  \ in \n# the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci\
  \ sequence.\n# Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\n# tri(1) = 3\n\
  # tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n# tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n\
  \ + 1), if n is odd.\n# For example:\n# tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n# tri(4) = 3\n\
  # tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n# = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n# You are given a non-negative\
  \ integer number n, you have to a return a list of the \n# first n + 1 numbers of\
  \ the Tribonacci sequence.\n# Examples:\n# >>> tri.call(3)\n# [1, 3, 2, 8]\ndef\
  \ tri(n)\n"
