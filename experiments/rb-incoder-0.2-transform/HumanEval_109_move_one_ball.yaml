prompt: "# We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n\
  # numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if\n\
  # it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing \n\
  # the following operation on the given array:\n# You are allowed to perform right\
  \ shift operation any number of times.\n# One right shift operation means shifting\
  \ all elements of the array by one\n# position in the right direction. The last\
  \ element of the array will be moved to\n# the starting position in the array i.e.\
  \ 0th index. \n# If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the\
  \ above operation\n# then return True else return False.\n# If the given array is\
  \ empty then return True.\n# Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\
  # For Example:\n# >>> move_one_ball.call([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])\n# true\n# Explanation:\
  \ By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n# be achieved\
  \ for the given array.\n# >>> move_one_ball.call([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])\n# false\n# Explanation:It\
  \ is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given\n# array by performing\
  \ any number of right shift operations.\ndef move_one_ball(arr)\n"
