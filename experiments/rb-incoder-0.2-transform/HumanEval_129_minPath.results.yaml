  program: "# Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer\
    \ k, \n# each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1,\
    \ N * N]\n# inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n# You have\
    \ to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n# from any\
    \ cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n# in other\
    \ words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n# cell.\n#\
    \ Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n# necessarily\
    \ distinct).\n# You CANNOT go off the grid.\n# A path A (of length k) is considered\
    \ less than a path B (of length k) if\n# after making the ordered lists of the\
    \ values on the cells that A and B go\n# through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B),\
    \ lst_A is lexicographically less\n# than lst_B, in other words, there exist an\
    \ integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n# such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j\
    \ (1 <= j < i) we have\n# lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n# It is guaranteed that the answer\
    \ is unique.\n# Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum\
    \ path go through.\n# Examples:    \n# >>> minPath.call([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6],\
