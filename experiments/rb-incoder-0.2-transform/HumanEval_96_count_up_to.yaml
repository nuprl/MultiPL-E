    Thanks. I understand now.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`prime?(i)` checks whether `i` is\
    \ prime. `i` could be any number between 1 and `n`, so `prime?(i)` checks whether\
    \ `i` is prime or not. `prime?(i)` returns `true` or `false`, so `if prime?(i)`\
    \ checks whether `i` is prime or not.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your explanation.\
