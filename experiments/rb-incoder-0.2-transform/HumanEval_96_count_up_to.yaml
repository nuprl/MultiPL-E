    \ For example, you can start from i = 2 in the first loop and increment it by\
    \ 2 each time instead of 1.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, you are right. I didn't notice\
    \ that at first. Thanks!\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI believe this can be further optimized\
    \ by removing the inner loop and using [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, it can be further optimized. But I thought this was a\
    \ good exercise to learn about prime numbers. I thought it would be better to\
    \ learn how to optimize it by hand than to learn the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\
