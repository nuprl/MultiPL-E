    \ I'm still trying to wrap my head around this solution. Can you explain what\
    \ each line is doing? I understand that `even` is selecting all the even numbers\
    \ in the list, but what is the `inject` method doing? I understand that `sum +\

    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`inject` is an Enumerable method that takes an initial value\
    \ and an action to perform on each element of the Enumerable. `sum + e` is performing\
    \ the `sum` on the initial value and the `e` on each element of the Enumerable.\
    \ `inject` will return the final value from the action. `inject` will return the\
