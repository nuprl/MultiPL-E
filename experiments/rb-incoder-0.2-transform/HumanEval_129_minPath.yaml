prompt: "# Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer\
  \ k, \n# each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1,\
  \ N * N]\n# inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n# You have\
  \ to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n# from any cell,\
  \ and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n# in other words,\
  \ you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n# cell.\n# Please note\
  \ that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n# necessarily distinct).\n\
  # You CANNOT go off the grid.\n# A path A (of length k) is considered less than\
  \ a path B (of length k) if\n# after making the ordered lists of the values on the\
  \ cells that A and B go\n# through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically\
  \ less\n# than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <=\
  \ k)\n# such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n# lst_A[j]\
  \ = lst_B[j].\n# It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n# Return an ordered\
  \ list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n# Examples:\
  \    \n# >>> minPath.call([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)\n# [1, 2, 1]\n#\
  \ >>> minPath.call([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1)\n# [1]\ndef minPath(grid,\
