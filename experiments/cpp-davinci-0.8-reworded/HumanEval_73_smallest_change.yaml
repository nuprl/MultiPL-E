prompt: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given a vector arr of integers,\
  \ find the minimum number of elements that\n// need to be changed to make the vector\
  \ palindromic. A palindromic vector is a vector that\n// is read the same backwards\
  \ and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.\n\
  // For example:\n// >>> smallest_change((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3,\
  \ (long)5, (long)4, (long)7, (long)9, (long)6})))\n// (4)\n// >>> smallest_change((std::vector<long>({(long)1,\
