prompt: "\"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns\
  \ a vector of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial\
  \ of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts\
  \ from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to\
  \ i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    >>> f(5)\n    [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\
