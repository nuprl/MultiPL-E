    \ also not sure if I'm using the right functions.\n\n\nA:\n\nYou're on the right\
    \ track, but you're missing a few things.\nFirst, you're not using <code>square</code>\
    \ correctly. It's a function that takes a single number and returns its square.\
    \ You're using it as if it were a function that takes a list of numbers and returns\
    \ a list of their squares.\nSecond, you're not using <code>and</code> correctly.\
    \ It's a function that takes two or more arguments and returns <code>#t</code>\
    \ if all of them are true, and <code>#f</code> otherwise. You're using it as if\
    \ it were a function that takes a list of arguments and returns <code>#t</code>\
    \ if all of them are true, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.\nThird, you're not using\
    \ <code>cond</code> correctly. You're using it as if it were a function that takes\
    \ a list of arguments and returns the first one that is true.\nFourth, you're\
    \ not using <code>empty?</code> correctly. It's a function that takes a list and\
    \ returns <code>#t</code> if the list is empty, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.\
    \ You're using it as if it were a function that takes a list of arguments and\
    \ returns <code>#t</code> if the list is empty, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.\n\
    Fifth, you're not using <code>integer?</code> correctly. It's a function that\
    \ takes a number and returns <code>#t</code> if the number is an integer, and\
    \ <code>#f</code> otherwise. You're using it as if it were a function that takes\
    \ a list of numbers and returns <code>#t</code> if all of them are integers, and\
