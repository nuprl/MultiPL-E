    \ false. `operation[1] < 0` will always return false because `operation[1]` is\
    \ an integer, and `0` is a method. `0` is an integer, so `0 < 0` is always false.\
    \ `operation[1] < 0` will always return false because `operation[1]` is an integer,\
    \ and `0` is a method. `0` is an integer, so `0 < 0` is always false. `operation[1]\

    \ is a very powerful language and I encourage you to learn more about it by reading\
    \ the [official documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/doc/index.html).\n\
    <|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI did read it but I am still confused about some things. I\
    \ understand that return will return from the function but what does it mean when\

    \ the function?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\n`return` will exit the loop and return from\
    \ the function, but it will also return the value to the calling function. So\
    \ if you call `below_zero` from inside another function, the calling function\
    \ will receive the return value of the called function.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI\
