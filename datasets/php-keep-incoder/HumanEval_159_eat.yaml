    </code>\n<|/ a tags=php,algorithm |>\n<| c |>\nI like the idea of using an array,\
    \ but I don't think it works in all cases. Consider `eat(1, 10, 10)` where `number`\
    \ is `1`, `need` is `10`, and `remaining` is `10`. The first loop will eat `1`\
    \ carrots, leaving `10` left. The second loop will eat `10` carrots, leaving `0`\
    \ left. `eat` should return `[11, 0]` but your function returns `[11, 1]`.\n<|/\
