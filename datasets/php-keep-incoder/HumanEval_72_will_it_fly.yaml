    Yes, the algorithm is O(n^2). One way to make it O(n) is to sort the array and\

    I believe this can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track\
    \ of the number of ways you can make each of the elements with the current weight\
    \ (let's call it W) by adding an element with the current weight (let's call it\
    \ W') to the current weight (W). \nSo the idea is to keep a table of size W+1\
    \ where each element in the table is represented as a number that represents the\
    \ number of ways to make that element with the current weight W. \nSo the table\
    \ would look something like this:\n<code>\nW  W'\n1   1\n2   1\n3   1\n4   1\n\
