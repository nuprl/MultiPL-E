    \ Python program to find the first non-repeating character in a given string.\n\
    \nExamples:\nGiven s = \"leetcode\", the function should return 'e' as it is the\
    \ first non-repeating character in s.\nGiven s = \"pwwkew\", the function should\
    \ return 'w' as the first non-repeating character in s.\nGiven s = \"abcabcbb\"\
    , the function should return 'b' as the first non-repeating character in s.\n\
    Given s = \"bbbbb\", the function should return '' as it is the first non-repeating\
    \ character in s.\nGiven s = \"\", the function should return '' as there is no\
    \ non-repeating character in s.\n\nNotes:\nYou may assume that the string contains\
    \ only lowercase or uppercase English letters.\nThe string length will be between\
    \ 1 and 10,000.\nThe input string may contain leading or trailing spaces or empty\
    \ spaces.\nYou may assume that the string length is at least 1.\n\n\n</text>\n\
