  \ is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n    If\
  \ it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n    all\
  \ the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return \"NO\"\
  .\n    For example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1,\
