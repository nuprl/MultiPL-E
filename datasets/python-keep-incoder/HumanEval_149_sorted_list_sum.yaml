  \    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n   \
  \ deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted\
  \ list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never\
  \ an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the\
  \ list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the\
  \ list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list\
  \ alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n\
  \    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n\
  \    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"\
  ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n"
