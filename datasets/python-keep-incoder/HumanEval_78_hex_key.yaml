prompt: "def hex_key(num: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a\
  \ function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number\
  \ of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural\
  \ number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\n\
  \    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n  \
  \  Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So you have to determine a\
  \ number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal\
  \ 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \n\
  \    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n    Examples:\n    For num =\
  \ \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n\
  \    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\"\
  \ the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\
