    \ sequence is defined by the formula:\n\n$Fn = \\begin{cases}\n1 & n = 0\\\n1\
    \ & n = 1 \\\nF{n-1} + F_{n-2} & n > 1\n\\end{cases}$\n\nwhere $F_n$ is the n-th\
    \ number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, the 6th number in the sequence\
    \ is $F_6 = 8$. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are $F_1=1$ and\
    \ $F_2=1$, so the first three terms in the Fibonacci sequence are $F_3 = F_1 +\
    \ F_2 = 1$ and $F_4 = F_3 + F_1 = 2$ and $F_5 = F_4 + F_2 = 1$. So the 8th number\
    \ in the sequence is $F_8 = F_5 + F_4 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nBy starting with $F_n =\
    \ F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ and iterating through the terms in the sequence $F_n$, we\
    \ can compute the entire sequence by adding the previous two terms. With every\
    \ iteration, we keep track of the current term $F_n$ and the previous two terms\
    \ $F_{n-1}$ and $F_{n-2}$ as we iterate through the sequence. By using the formula\
    \ $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ to compute the next term in the sequence, we get the\
    \ following sequence:\n\n$Fn = \\begin{cases}\n1 & n = 0\\\n1 & n = 1 \\\nF{n-1}\
    \ + F_{n-2} & n > 1\n\\end{cases}$\n\nFor example, iterating through the sequence\
    \ $F_5$, the current term is $F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 1 + 2 = 3$ and the previous terms\
    \ are $F_4 = 1 + 2 = 3$ and $F_3 = 2$. So we compute the next term in the sequence\
    \ by adding the previous two terms: $F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 1 + 3 = 4$ and $F_4 = 1\
    \ + 3 = 4$ and $F_3 = 5$. So we compute the next term in the sequence by adding\
    \ the previous two terms: $F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 1 + 4 = 5$ and ", "    even = 0\n\

    \ by the formula:\n\n$Fn = \\begin{cases}\n1 & n = 0\\\n1 & n = 1 \\\nF{n-1} +\
    \ F_{n-2} & n > 1\n\\end{cases}$\n\nwhere $F_n$ is the n-th number in the Fibonacci\
    \ sequence. An example of a Fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,\
    \ 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nThe first two terms in the Fibonacci sequence are both 1.\
    \ Every third term in the sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.\n\
    \nBy starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,\
    \ 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nBy considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence\
    \ whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.\n\
