    </cell>\n<text>\nPart 3: Deposit and Withdrawal\nNow that you've seen how to use\
    \ loops to solve a problem, let's see how we can use loops to solve a problem\
    \ with multiple operations.\n\nThe bank has two types of accounts: savings and\
    \ checkings. Savings accounts start off with a balance and can withdraw money\
    \ from the account and deposit money into it. Checking accounts start off with\
    \ no money in them and can only deposit money into them. Write a program that\
    \ uses loops to allow the user to deposit and withdraw money from the bank accounts.\
    \ At the end of the program, print out how many checking and savings accounts\
    \ were created, and how many checking and savings accounts were overdrawn.\n\n\
    The program should allow the user to deposit money into the account and withdraw\
    \ money from the account. After the program is run, the program should display\
    \ how many checking and savings accounts were created, and how many checking and\
    \ savings accounts were overdrawn.\n\nThe program should allow the user to deposit\
    \ money into the account and withdraw money from the account. After the program\
    \ is run, the program should display how many checking and savings accounts were\
    \ created, and how many checking and savings accounts were overdrawn.\n\nThe program\
    \ should allow the user to deposit money into the account and withdraw money from\
    \ the account. After the program is run, the program should display how many checking\
    \ and savings accounts were created, and how many checking and savings accounts\
    \ were overdrawn.\n\nThe program should allow the user to deposit money into the\
    \ account and withdraw money from the account. After the program is run, the program\
    \ should display how many checking and savings accounts were created, and how\
    \ many checking and savings accounts were overdrawn.\n\nThe program should allow\
