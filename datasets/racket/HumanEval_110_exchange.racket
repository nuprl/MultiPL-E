;; In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
;; and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
;; between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
;; There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
;; If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
;; all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
;; Otherwise, return "NO".
;; For example:
;; exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
;; exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
;; It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
