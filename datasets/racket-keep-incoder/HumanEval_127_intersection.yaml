prompt: "#lang racket\n\n;; You are given two intervals,\n;; where each interval is\
  \ a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n;; The given\
  \ intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)\n;; includes both\
  \ start and end.\n;; For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less\
  \ or equal its end.\n;; Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection\
  \ of these two \n;; intervals is a prime number.\n;; Example, the intersection of\
  \ the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n;; which its length is 1, which not a\
  \ prime number.\n;; If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return\
  \ \"YES\",\n;; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n;; If the two intervals don't intersect,\
  \ return \"NO\".\n;; [input/output] samples:\n;; intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==>\
  \ \"NO\"\n;; intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n;; intersection((-3, -1),\
