  \ deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n;; then\
  \ check if the result string is palindrome.\n;; A string is called palindrome if\
  \ it reads the same backward as forward.\n;; You should return a tuple containing\

  , c = \"ae\", the result should be ('bcd',False)\n;; For s = \"abcdef\", c = \"\
