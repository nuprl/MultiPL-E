prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic\
  \ algebra operations, and \n    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two\
  \ given lists to build the algebric \n    expression and return the evaluation of\
  \ this expression.\n\n    The basic algebra operations:\n    Addition ( + ) \n \
  \   Subtraction ( - ) \n    Multiplication ( * ) \n    Floor division ( // ) \n\
  \    Exponentiation ( ** ) \n\n    Example:\n    operator['+', '*', '-']\n    array\
  \ = [2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n    => result = 9\n\n    Note:\n \
  \       The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus\
  \ one.\n        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.\n        Operator\
  \ list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.\n\n\
