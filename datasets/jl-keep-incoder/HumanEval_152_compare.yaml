prompt: "\"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n\
  \    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n\
  \    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine\
  \ if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are\
  \ given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows\
  \ a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess\
  \ was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value\
  \ is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    \n    example:\n\
  \n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])\

    \ a function called compare_all() that takes in an array of games and an array\
    \ of guesses, and returns an array of scores. Each score should be the absolute\
    \ difference between the guess and the score. \nThe function should return an\
    \ array of scores denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\
    \ the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the\
    \ guess and the score.", "    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \
