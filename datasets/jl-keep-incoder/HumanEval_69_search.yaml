prompt: "\"\"\"\n    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the\

    \ Searching in a Sorted Array\nA binary search is similar to searching in a sorted\
    \ array, but instead of searching for a specific value, it searches for a specific\
    \ index. \nThe binary search is also called a binary search because it is based\
    \ on the idea of dividing the array into two halves, \none half containing the\
    \ smaller elements and the other half containing the larger elements. \nThe search\
    \ is then done on the smaller half of the array. \nThe binary search is guaranteed\
    \ to terminate when the element is not present in the array. \nThe binary search\
    \ is guaranteed to be logarithmic when the array is sorted.", "    \n    \n  \

    \ 2: BSTs\nA binary search tree is a binary tree in which each node has a value\
    \ that compares larger than all other nodes in the tree. \nThe left subtree of\
    \ a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value. The right\
    \ subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.\n\
