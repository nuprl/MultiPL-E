// Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
// x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
// otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
// <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.
// You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.
// simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
// simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
// simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False
func simplify(x: String, n: String) -> Bool {
