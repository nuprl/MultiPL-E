// You are given two intervals,
// where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
// The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
// includes both start and end.
// For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
// Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
// intervals is a prime number.
// Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
// which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
// If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
// otherwise, return "NO".
// If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".
// [input/output] samples:
// intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
// intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
// intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
