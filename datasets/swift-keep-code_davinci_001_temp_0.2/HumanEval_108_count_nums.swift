// Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
// >>> count_nums([]) == 0
// >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
// >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
