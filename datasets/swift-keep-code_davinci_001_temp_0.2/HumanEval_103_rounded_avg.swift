// You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
// average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
// Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
// If n is greater than m, return -1.
// Example:
// rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
// rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
// rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
// rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
