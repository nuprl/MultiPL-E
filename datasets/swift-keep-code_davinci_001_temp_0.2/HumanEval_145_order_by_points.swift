// Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
// in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
// Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
// order them based on their index in original list.
// For example:
// >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
// >>> order_by_points([]) == []
func order_by_points(nums: [Int]) -> [Int] {
