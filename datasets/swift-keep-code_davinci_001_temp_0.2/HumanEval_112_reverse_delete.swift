// Task
// We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
// then check if the result string is palindrome.
// A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
// You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
// Example
// For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
// For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
// For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
func reverse_delete(s: String, c: String) -> (String, Bool) {
	fatalError("unimplemented")
