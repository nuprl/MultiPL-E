// Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
// the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
// Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
// tri(1) = 3
// tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
// tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
// For example:
// tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
// tri(4) = 3
// tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
// = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
// You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
// first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
// Examples:
// tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
func tri(n: Int) -> [Int] {
	fatalError("unimplemented")
