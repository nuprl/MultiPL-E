// Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
// each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
// inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.
// You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
// from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
// in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
// cell.
// Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
// necessarily distinct).
// You CANNOT go off the grid.
// A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
// after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
// through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
// than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
// such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
// lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
// It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
// Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.
// Examples:
// Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
// Output: [1, 2, 1]
// Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
// Output: [1]
