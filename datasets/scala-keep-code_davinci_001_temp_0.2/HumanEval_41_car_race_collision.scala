    // Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    // n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    // are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    // each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    // when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    // However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    // in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
