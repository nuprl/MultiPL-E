prompt: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// \"Given an array representing\
  \ a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes\n// your task is to pluck\
  \ one of the nodes and return it.\n// The plucked node should be the node with the\
  \ smallest even value.\n// If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are\
  \ found return the node that has smallest index.\n// The plucked node should be\
  \ returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],\n// If there are no even values\
  \ or the given array is empty, return [].\n// Example 1:\n// Input: [4,2,3]\n//\
  \ Output: [2, 1]\n// Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest\
  \ index.\n// Example 2:\n// Input: [1,2,3]\n// Output: [2, 1]\n// Explanation: 2\
  \ has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. \n// Example 3:\n//\
  \ Input: []\n// Output: []\n// Example 4:\n// Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\n// Output:\
  \ [0, 1]\n// Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n//\
  \ so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n// Constraints:\n\
  // * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n// * 0 <= node.value\nstd::vector<long> pluck(std::vector<long>\
