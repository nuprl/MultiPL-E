prompt: "\"\"\"You are given two intervals,\n    where each interval is a pair of\
  \ integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n    The given intervals\
  \ are closed which means that the interval (start, end)\n    includes both start\
  \ and end.\n    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or\
  \ equal its end.\n    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection\
  \ of these two \n    intervals is a prime number.\n    Example, the intersection\
  \ of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n    which its length is 1, which not\
  \ a prime number.\n    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return\
  \ \"YES\",\n    otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    If the two intervals don't intersect,\
  \ return \"NO\".\n\n\n    [input/output] samples:\n    intersection((1, 2), (2,\
  \ 3)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-3,\
