prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n\
  \    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n\
  \    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far\
  \ from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to\
  \ collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right\
  \ to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result,\
  \ they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n\
  \    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"\nfunction\
