prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version\
  \ of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated\
  \ by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n\
  \    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order\
  \ of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi')\
