prompt: "\"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number\
  \ of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\
  \n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n\
  \        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are\
  \ odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n\
  \        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are\
  \ even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n       \
  \ 2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n\
