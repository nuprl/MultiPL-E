prompt: "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// You are given two intervals,\n\
  // where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end)\
  \ = (1, 2).\n// The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start,\
  \ end)\n// includes both start and end.\n// For each given interval, it is assumed\
  \ that its start is less or equal its end.\n// Your task is to determine whether\
  \ the length of intersection of these two \n// intervals is a prime number.\n//\
  \ Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n// which\
  \ its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n// If the length of the intersection\
  \ is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n// otherwise, return \"NO\".\n// If the two\
  \ intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\n// [input/output] samples:\n// intersection((1,\
