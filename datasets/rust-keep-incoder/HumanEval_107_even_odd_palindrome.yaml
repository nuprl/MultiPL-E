prompt: "/// Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even\
  \ and odd\n/// integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\
  /// Example 1:\n/// Input: 3\n/// Output: (1, 2)\n/// Explanation:\n/// Integer\
  \ palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n/// Example\
  \ 2:\n/// Input: 12\n/// Output: (4, 6)\n/// Explanation:\n/// Integer palindrome\
  \ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\
