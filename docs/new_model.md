# Evaluate a New Model

To evaluate a new model, you need to add a script for the model to the
[inference](https://github.com/nuprl/MultiPL-E/tree/main/inference) directory.
The file [codegen2b.py] is a concise example that should work for most
CausalLM's on the Hugging Face hub.

When you're done, you can your model using the same steps outlined
in the [Tutorial].
